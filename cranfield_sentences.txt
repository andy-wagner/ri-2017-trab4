experimental investigation of the aerodynamics ofan experimental study ofwing inpropeller slipstream was
made in order to determine the spanwise distribution of the lift
increase due to slipstream at different angles of attack of the wing
and at different free stream to slipstream velocity ratiosthe
results were intended in part as an evaluation basis for different
theoretical treatments of this problemthe comparative span loading curves, together with supporting
evidence, showed thatsubstantial part of the lift increment
produced by the slipstream was due to/destalling/ or boundary-layer-control
effectthe integrated remaining lift increment,
after subtracting this destalling lift, was found to agree
well withpotential flow theoryan empirical evaluation of the destalling effects was made for
the specific configuration of the experiment .simple shear flow pastflat plate in an incompressible fluid of small

is usually necessary to considercurved shock wave emitting from the
nose or leading edge of the bodyconsequently, there exists an inviscid
rotational flow region between the shock wave and the boundary layersuchsituation arises, for instance, in the study of the hypersonic
viscous flow pastflat platethe situation is somewhat different
from prandtl's classical boundary-layer problemin prandtl's
original problem the inviscid free stream outside the boundary layer is
irrotational while inhypersonic boundary-layer problem the inviscid
free stream must be considered as rotationalthe possible effects of
vorticity have been recently discussed by ferri and libbyin the present
paper, the simple shear flow pastflat plate influid of small
viscosity is investigatedit can be shown that this problem can again
be treated by the boundary-layer approximation, the only novel feature
being that the free stream hasconstant vorticitythe discussion
here is restricted to two-dimensional incompressible steady flow .the boundary layer in simple shear flow pastflat platethe boundary-layer equations are presented for steady

three particular cases..propose here to give the general solution
to this problem, to indicate
briefly how it is obtained using the method of
reference 2, and to point out
that the solutions given by wassermann are
incomplete for times longer
than the duration of the heat input .the effect of controlled three-dimensional roughness
experiments were performed in the 12-in. supersonic wind
tunnel of the jet propulsion laboratory of the california institute
of technology to investigate the effect of three-dimensional
roughness elements (spheres) on boundary-layer transition ontained at local mach numbers of 1.90, 2.71, and 3.67 by varying
trip size, position, spacing, and reynolds number per inchthe results indicate that (1) transition from laminar to turbulent
flow induced by three-dimensional roughness elements begins
when the double row of spiral vortices trailing each element contaminates
and breaks down the surrounding field of vorticity, (2)
transition appears rather suddenly, becoming more violent with
increasing roughness height relative to the boundary-layer thickness,
(3) after the breakdown of the vorticity field, the strength
of the spiral vortices may still persist in the sublayer of the ensuing
turbulent flow, (4) lateral spacing of roughness elements has
little effect upon the initial breakdown (contamination) of the
laminar flow, and (5) the trip reynolds number whereandare the velocity and kinematic viscosity at the outer edge of
the boundary layer andis roughness height, such that transition
occurs at the roughness position, varies as the position reynolds
number to the one-fourth power, viz., whereis

dryden found, on the basis of available data, that the effect
oftwo-dimensional roughness element such as/trip wire/

between and, where is the reynolds number
of transition based on distance from the leading edge, is the
height of the roughness element, and is the boundary-layer

suggestion some additional data were obtained, primarily to
extend the range to higher values of, during the course of an
investigation of transition onflat plate conducted at the
national bureau of standardsafter the results on the twodimensional
roughness elements were obtained, it appeared to be
desirable to see whetherrow of three-dimensional roughness
elements would behave in the same way .transition studies and skin friction measurements on
an investigation of transition and skin friction on an insulated
flat plate,by 26 in., was made in the galcitbyin.
hypersonic wind tunnel atnominal mach number of 5.8the phosphorescent lacquer technique was used for transition
detection and was found to be in good agreement with total-head
rake measurements along the plate surface and pitot boundarylayer
surveysit was found that the boundary layer was
laminar at reynolds numbers of at leastx 10transverse

tunnel sidewall originated far downstream of the flat plate leading
edge at reynolds numbers of 1.5 tox 10, and spread atuniform angle ofcompared todegree in low-speed flowthe effect of two-dimensional and local disturbances was investigatedthe technique of air injection into the boundary
layer asmeans of hastening transition was extensively usedalthough the onset of transition occurred at reynolds numbers
as low as 10,fully developed turbulent boundary layer was
not obtained at reynolds numbers much belowx 10 regardless
of the amount of air injecteda qualitative discussion of these results is given with emphasis
on the possibility ofgreater stability of the laminar boundary
layer in hypersonic flow than at lower speedsdirect skin-friction measurements were made by means of the
floating element technique, overrange of reynolds numbers
verified as being laminar over the complete rangewith air
injection, turbulent shear was obtained only for reynolds numbers
greater thanx 10, this value being in good agreement with
earlier results of this investigationthe turbulent skin-friction
coefficient was found to be approximately 0.40 of that for incompressible
flow forconstant value of r, and 0.46 for an effective
reynolds number betweenandx 10 .the theory of the impact tube at low pressurea theoretical analysis has been made for an impact tube of the
relation between free-stream mach number and the impact and
free-stream pressures and densities for extremely low pressuresit is shown that the results differ appreciably from the corresponding
continuum relations .similar solutions in compressible laminar free mixing
there are in supersonic aerodynamics many situations of
practical interest wherein streams of different velocities and,
in general, different stagnation pressures mix with one anotherin the majority of these problems the interaction between the
two streams takes place in the presence of an axial pressure gradientits effect on the characteristics of the mixing may influence
significantly the performances of the devices wherein
the phenomena cited above occura theoretical and experimental
program of research to study mixing in the presence of
axial pressure gradients is being carried on at the polytechnic
institute of brooklyn .some structural and aerelastic considerations of high
the dominating factors in structural design of high-speed
aircraft are thermal and aeroelastic in originthe subject
matter is concerned largely withdiscussion of these factors and
their interrelation with one anothera summary is presented
of some of the analytical and experimental tools available to
aeronautical engineers to meet the demands of high-speed flight
upon aircraft structuresthe state of the art with respect to
heat transfer from the boundary layer into the structure, modes
of failure under combined load as well as thermal inputs and
acrothermoelasticity is discussedmethods of attacking and
alleviating structural and aeroelastic problems of high-speed
flight are summarizedfinally, some avenues of fundamental
research are suggested .similarity laws for stressing heated wingsit will be shown that the differential equations forheated
plate with large temperature gradient and forsimilar plate at
constant temperature can be made the same byproper modification
of the thickness and the loading for the isothermal platethis fact leads to the result that the stresses in the heated plate
can be calculated from measured strains on the unheated plate byseries of relations, called the /similarity laws ./  the application
of this analog theory to solid wings under aerodynamic heating
is discussed in detailthe loading on the unheated analog
wing is, however, complicated and involves the novel concept
of feedback and /body force/ loadingthe problem of stressingheated box-wing structure can be solved by the same analog
method and is briefly discussed .piston theorya new aerodynamic tool for the aeroelastician
representative applications are described which illustrate the
extent to which simplifications in the solutions of high-speed unsteady
aeroelastic problems can be achieved through the use of
certain aerodynamic techniques known collectively as /piston
theory ./  based onphysical model originally proposed by
hayes and lighthill, piston theory for airfoils and finite wings
has been systematically developed by landahl, utilizing expansions
in powers of the thickness ratio and the inverse of the
flight mach number.  when contributions of orders and
are negligible, the theory predictspoint-function relationship
between the local pressure on the surface ofwing and the
normal component of fluid velocity produced by the wing's
motionthe computation of generalized forces in aeroelastic
equations, such as the flutter determinant, is then always reduced
to elementary integrations of the assumed modes of motionessentially closed-form solutions are given for the bendingtorsion
and control-surface flutter properties of typical section airfoils
at high mach numbersthese agree well with results of
more exact theories wherever comparisons can be fairly mademoreover, they demonstrate the increasingly important influence
of thickness and profile shape asgrows larger,discovery that
would be almost impossible using other available aerodynamic
toolsthe complexity of more practical flutter analyses-e.g., on
three-dimensional wings and panels-is shown to be substantially
reduced by piston theoryan iterative procedure is outlined, by
which improved flutter eigenvalues can be found through the
successive introduction of higher-order terms in andother applications to unsteady supersonic problems are reviewed,
including gust response and rapid maneuvers of elastic
aircraftsteady-state aeroelastic calculations are also discussed,
but for them piston theory amounts only toslight modification
of ackeret's formulassuggestions are made regarding future research based on the
new aerodynamic method, with particular emphasis on areas where
computational labor can be reduced withminimum loss of precisionit is pointed out thatmach number zone exists where
thermal effects are appreciable but nonlinear viscous interactions
may be neglected, and that in this zone piston theory is the logical
way of estimating air loads when analyzing aerodynamic-thermoelastic
interaction problems .on two-dimensional panel fluttertheory and experiments of the flutter ofbuckled plate are
discussedit is shown that an increase in the initial deviation
from flatness orstatic pressure differential across the plate
raises the critical value of the /reduced velocity ./the applicability of the galerkin method to the linearized
problem of flutter of an unbuckled plate has been questioned by
several authorsin this paper the flutter condition was formulated
in the form of an integral equation and solved numerically
by the method of iteration and the method of matrix approximations,
thus avoiding the constraint of assumed modesforplate (with finite bending rigidity) the results confirm those
given by the galerkin methodan approximate analysis of the limiting form and amplitude of
the flutter motion forbuckled plate is presented .transformation of the compressible turbulent boundary
the transformation of the compressible turbulent boundarylayer
equations to their incompressible equivalent is demonstrated
analyticallythe transformation is essentially the same
as that for the laminar layer, first given by stewartson, except
that the explicit relation between the viscosity and temperature
is not requireda key point in the analysis is the modification
of the stream function to includemean of the fluctuating components
and the postulate that the apparent turbulent shear,
associated with an elemental mass, remains invariant in the
transformationthe values of the incompressible friction coefficients and of
pressure rise causing separation thus transformed show good
agreement with the experimentally measured and independently
reported resultsan application of the transformation to the
self-preserving boundary layers and to the computations of
general boundary-layer flow is shown .remarks on the eddy viscosity in compressible mixing flowsin connection withstudy of the wakes behind bodies in hypersonic flow
carried out for the missile and space vehicle division of the general
electric company, it was desired to estimate the eddy viscosity in
axisymmetric, compressible wakesbecause of the lack of applicable
experimental data, it was found necessary to make such an estimate by
rationally extending the few available data for incompressible flows to
the compressible casethis suggested the application and extension of
the transformations applied to turbulent boundary layers in reference
infinitesimal mass are invariant with transformation, mager showed that
the partial differential equations for the compressible turbulent boundary
layer can be transformed to incompressible formthe validity of
this assumption and of the transformations was established for several
boundary-layer flows by comparison with experiment .the flow field in the diffuser ofradial compressorthis note discusses the two-dimensional diffuser flow field
inradial compressor outside the impeller wheelit is
assumed that the diffuser has guide vanes arranged incircular
row atradiusthe impeller wheel has the radius (see
fig. 1)the flow in the diffuser starts at the circle with the
radiusthe velocity components, and in theand
directions of the velocity vector on this circle are prescribed
together with the thermal state of the gasthe flow so prescribed
on the radius will, if no disturbances are present (i.e., no
boundary conditions in the flow other than zero velocity at infinity
are to be fulfilled), develop inspiral flow .an investigation of the pressure distribution on conical bodies inlarge amount of work on conical flow fields without axial symmetry
at supersonic speed is presently availablehowever, no apparent
hypersonic approximation has yet been derivedin this note, experimental
data on two elliptical cones at=are presented andhypersonic
approach obtained from physical considerations is suggested .generalised-newtonian theoryauthor generalizes lees's (amr 10(1957), rev. 2601) modification
of newtonian theory for blunt-nose bodies to apply to pointednose
bodies as wellthe result is expressed by
sin where is the local inclination of the body surface
and the subscript /max/ refers to the maximum local inclination
and pressure coefficientfor blunt-nose bodies
and the generalized theory reverts to lees's blunt-nose modification
with given by normal shock relationsauthor shows,
by comparison of newtonian and generalized-newtonian theory
with exact solutions, the superiority of generalized-newtonian
theoryhe also shows that both two-dimensional and axisymmetric
shapes are correlated by this generalizationresults are
presented in two figures that support author's generalization and
indicate the independence of the correlation from variations in
both the hypersonic similarity parameter= m(d1) and the ratio
of specific heats.reviewer believes this generalization should be of interest to
those engaged in development of hypersonic hardware as well as
theory .on heat transfer in slip flowa number of authors have considered the effect of slip on the heat transfer
and skin friction inlaminar boundary layer overflat platereferenceconsiders this byperturbation on the usual laminar
boundary-layer analysis while some other studies.dash e.g., reference
the impulsive motion of an infinite plate .on slip-flow heat transfer toflat plateassuming that continuum flow energy equation inboundary
layer remains valid well into slip region and taking account of the
temperature jump inmoving rarefied gas and for influence of
large mean free path through appropriate boundary conditions,solution is found for the temperature gradient in the slip regionthen from maslen expression (j. aero. sci. 25, 6, 400-401, june
slipping fluid toflat plate, and behavior confirms results for
small values of knudsen number .skin-friction and heat transfer characteristics ofsolution is given for the case of the laminar boundary layer
of an incompressible fluid of constant properties on the exterior
ofcylinder with flow parallel to the cylinder axisthis case
differs from the blasius solution for flow alongflat plate by
considering the effect of the curvature inplane transverse to
the flow directionthe local skin-friction and heat-transfer
coefficients forprandtl number of 0.715 are evaluated and
compared to the similar magnitudes for flat plate flow, and the
effect of the curvature is shown to be significant in some practical
casesrecovery factors are evaluated, and this quantity is
found to be insensitive to the effect of curvature of the boundary .theory of stagnation point heat transfer in dissociated
the boundary-layer equations are developed in general for the
case of very high speed flight where the external flow is indissociated
statein particular the effects of diffusion and of atom
recombination in the boundary layer are includedit is shown
that at the stagnation point the equations can be reduced exactly
toset of nonlinear ordinary differential equations even when the
chemical reactions proceed so slowly that the boundary layer is
not in thermochemical equilibriumtwo methods of numerical solution of these stagnation point
equations are presented, one for the equilibrium case and the
other for the nonequilibrium casenumerical results are correlated
in terms of the parameters entering the numerical formulation
so as not to depend critically on the physical assumptions
madefor the nonequilibrium boundary layer, both catalytic (to
atom recombination) and noncatalytic wall surfaces are considereda solution is represented which shows the transition
from the /frozen/ boundary layer (very slow recombination
rates) to the equilibrium boundary layer (fast recombination rates)a recombination rate parameter is introduced to interpret the
nonequilibrium results, and it is shown thatscale factor is involved
in relating the equilibrium state ofboundary layer on
bodies of different sizesit is concluded that the heat transfer through the equilibrium
stagnation point boundary layer can be computed accurately bysimple correlation formula and that the heat
transfer is almost unaffected bynonequilibrium state of the
boundary layer provided the wall is catalytic and the lewis
number near unity .inviscid hypersonic flow over blunt-nosed slender bodiesat hypersonic speeds the drag area ofblunt nose is much
larger than the drag area ofslender afterbody, and the energy
contained in the flow field inplane at right angles to the flight
direction is nearly constant overdownstream distance many
times greater than the characteristic nose dimensionthe
transverse flow field exhibits certain similarity properties directly
analogous to the flow similarity behind an intense blast wave
found by g. i. taylor, s. c. lin, and a. sakuraia comparison
with the experiments of hammitt, vas, and bogdonoff onflat plate withblunt leading edge at in helium shows
that the shock-wave shape is predicted very accurately by this
similarity analysisthe predicted surface pressure distribution
is somewhat less satisfactoryexperimental results onhemisphere-cylinder
obtained at in the galcit air tunnel
indicate that not only the shock-wave shape but also the surface
pressures for this body are given very closely by the similarity
theory, except near the hemisphere-cylinder junctionenergy considerations combined withdetailed study of the
equations of motion show that flow similarity is also possible forclass of bodies of the form, provided that,
where fortwo-dimensional body and forbody of revolutionwhen the shock shape is not
similar to the body shape, and the entire flow field some distance
from the nose must depend to some extent on the details
of the nose geometryby again utilizing energy and drag considerations one finds
that at hypersonic speeds the inviscid surface pressures generated
byblunt leading edge are larger than the pressures induced
by boundary-layer growth on an insulated flat surface
for an insulated blunt-nosed slender body of revolution the
corresponding distance is given by(here
is free-stream reynolds number based on leading-edge
thickness, or nose diameter .)  in free flight these constants are
replaced by 1,700 and 20, respectively, so that viscous interaction
effects are important over the forward portion ofbluntnosed
slender body only for relatively low values ofhowever,
/far downstream/ of the nose the inviscid over-pressure is
small and viscous interaction phenomena will have to be taken
into account .inviscid leading-edge effect in hypersonic flowcurrent interest in the problem of inviscid-viscous interaction
has led to the realization of the significant effect of
the leading-edge thickness in hypersonic flowthe purpose
of this note is to give an account of the downstream influence
of the blunt leading edge on the basis of the hypersonic small
perturbation theory .newtonian flow theory for slender bodiesas an aid to the aerodynamieist in the design of air frames for
hypersonic speeds (speeds faster than about mach 5), newtonian
flow theory is examined from the point of view of gas dynamics
and hypersonic small-disturbance theorythe usual theory is
shown to result as the first approximation of an expansion valid
for smalla basic similarity parameter
is introduceda general solution
of the first approximation for the flow past slender bodies (bodies
which cause onlysmall disturbance to the stream) at zero angle
of attack is givenan important condition which limits the
application of the theory is noted-namely, that the pressure
coefficient on the surface not fall to zerothe theory is then applied
to cones and to bodies whose shape is .a note on the explosion solution of sedov with application
an exact analytical solution of the equations of inviscid compressible
unsteady flow has been given by sedov (reference
to the solution may be made through hayes and probstein)this solution is the similarity solution forconstant-energy point
explosionin view of the recent work on problems of hypersonic
flow in the limiting form of the ratio of specific heats nearsolution in this limit and inquire what form suchsolution would
takeeinbinder, inrecent note, has examined the solution for
various but does not mention the interesting case ofit may be shown that the convergence to the limit is nonuniform
over the flow fieldit is also not difficult to show that the nonuniform
behavior exhibited here is that which one would expect
from the newtonian formulation as derived in reference.a simple model study of transient temperature and thermal
the present work is concerned with the determination of transient
temperatures and thermal stresses in simple models intended
to simulate parts or the whole of an aircraft structure of the builtup
variety subjected to aerodynamic heatingthe first case considered is that of convective heat transfer
into one side offlat plate, representingthick skin, and the
effect of the resulting temperature distribution in inducing thermal
stresses associated with bending restraint at the plate edgesnumerical results are presented for the transient temperature differentials
in the plate when the environment temperature first
increases linearly with time and then remains constant, the
period of linear increase representing the time of acceleration of
the aircraftcorresponding thermal stress information is presentedthe second case is that of the wide-flanged i-beam with convective
heat transfer into the outer faces of the flangesnumerical
results are presented for transient temperature differentials forwide range of values of the applicable parameters and for an environment
temperature variation as described abovecorresponding
thermal stresses inbeam of infinite length are determineda theoretical analysis of the stress distribution inbeam
of finite length is carried out and numerical results obtained for
one casean experimental investigation of temperatures and
stresses in suchbeam is described, and results are presented
which indicate good agreement with corresponding theoretical
results .photo-thermoelastic investigation of transient thermal
photothermoelastic experiments were performed onlong multiweb
wing model for whichtheoretical analysis is available in
the literaturethe experimental procedures utilized to simulate
the conditions prescribed in the theory are fully describedcorrelation of theory and experiment in terms of dimensionless
temperature, stress, time, and biot number revealed that the
theory predicted values higher than the experimentally observed
maximum thermal stresses at the center of the webdetailed
temperature measurements in the flange suggested that the major
source of this discrepancy can be traced to the one-dimensional
heat conduction analysis of the flange employed in the theory .thermal buckling of supersonic wing panelsthe temperature and thermal stress distributions are analyzed
in multicellular supersonic wing structuresa buckling criterion
is established for the panels of cover plates subjected to thermal
stresses .the dynamic motion ofmissile descending throughmethod is presented for computing rapidly, yet accurately,
the dynamic motion ofballistic-type missile descending through
the atmospherethe equations of motion are separated intoset of /static/ trajectory equations (zero angle of attack) andset of /rotational/ equations describing the oscillatory motion
of the missile about its center of gravitya transformation
allows the rotational equations to be written inmanner analogous
to the equation for an undamped oscillating spring mass
system with the mass equal to unity andtime variable spring
constantfor given initial conditions this equation can be
solved to obtain the envelope of maximum angle of attackan
additional transformation allows the calculation of the complete
oscillatory motion at any time during the trajectory asfunction
of the maximum angle of attack at that timethis solution shows that the maximum angle of attack ofmissile descending through the atmosphere at relatively constant
speed is reduced even when the aerodynamic damping is neglected .the prospects for magneto-aerodynamicsthe equations describing the flow of an electrically conducting
fluid in the presence of electric and magnetic fields are written
down with the aid of certain simplifications appropriate to
aeronautical applicationsin order to estimate the probable
significance of magneto-aerodynamic effects, some data on
conductivity of pure and /seeded/ air are first examineddimensionless
quantities representing the ratios of forces and of
currents are then formed and their values studied for conditions
of flight in the atmospheresome examples of magneto-hydrodynamic and magnetogasdynamic
effects in simple flows are giventhese include
two cases of poiscuille flow of conducting liquids with applied
magnetic fields and the case of quasi-one-dimensional gas flow
with applied electrical and magnetic fieldsin the last case,
attractive possibilities are found for controlled acceleration or
deceleration of gas at subsonic and supersonic speeds, even in
constant-area channelsthe behavior of the flow is characteristically
different in different regimes of mach number and flow
speed relative to certain /significant speeds/ that are dependent
on the ratio of electrical to magnetic field strengthsthese
are studied, andchart is constructed to relate the length to
the speed ratio ofmaximum-acceleration constant-area channelit is concluded that the advantages that may accrue from
magneto-aerodynamic methods are sufficiently attractive to
justify the considerable research and engineering development
that will be requiredamong the unsolved engineering problems
are the reduction of surface resistance of electrodes in contact
withconducting gas, development of techniques for seeding,
and provision of the required magnetic fields in flight .constant-temperature magneto-gasdynamic channel flowin the course of investigating boundary-layer flow in continuous
plasma accelerators with crossed electric and magnetic
fields, it was found advantageous to have at hand simple
closed-form solutions for the magneto-gasdynamic flow in the
duct which could serve as free-stream conditions for the boundary
layersnontrivial solutions of this sort are not available at
present, and in fact, as in the work of resler and sears, the
variation of conditions along the flow axis must be obtained
through numerical integrationconsequently, some simple solutions of magneto-gasdynamic
channel flow were sought, possessing sufficient algebraic simplicity
to serve as free-stream boundary conditions for analytic investigations
of the boundary layer inphysically reasonable acceleratorin particular, since the cooling of the accelerator tube is likely to
be an important physical problem because of the high gas temperatures
required to provide sufficient gaseous conductivity,
channel flow with constant temperature appears interestingsome simple algebraic solutions for the case ofconstant temperature
plasma are developed in the following paragraphs .stagnation point ofblunt body in hypersonic flowthe purpose of this paper is to presentmethod of calculation
devised to yield all the important information on the symmetric
inviscid hypersonic flow in the stagnation point region ofblunt
bodythe problem is the same as that considered by hayes
who usedslightly different approachit is demonstrated that
hayes' results are valid in the stagnation point region and can
hence be consideredbasis for constructing less restricted solutionsequations are presented giving velocity, pressure, detachment
distance, and vorticitythe values of shock detachment distance
and body pressure coefficient are compared with experimental
data for spheresthe pressure comparison shows that
the results of hayes and the theory presented herein representbetter approximation than the newtonian impact theory for
hypersonic mach numbersin conclusion, the possibility of refinements to this analysis is
discussed .supersonic flow around blunt bodiesthe newtonian theory of impact has been shown to be
useful for pressure calculations on the forward facing part
of bodies moving at high speedit is nowfamiliar practice
to use this information to calculate nonviscous velocities at the
wall and then to estimate rates of heat transferthis procedure
is perhaps open to question,. heat-transfer rates depend
on velocity gradients which are not given by the newtonian
analysisnor can one obtain information on boundary-layer
stability or all the body stability derivativesit seems, therefore,
inevitable that, as design proceeds with these hypersonic
missiles, there will begreater need for more accurate aerodynamic
theories either to predict what will happen in unfamiliar
flight conditions or to effect an extrapolation fromknown test
result to the design condition .a new technique for investigating heat transfer and
on the forebody of many practically interesting hypersonic
vehicles, there is little interaction between the inviscid
flow field and the boundary layertherefore, inviscid flow theory
can be used to determine, independent of surface phenomena,
the physically interesting quantities such as shock shape, shock
detachment distance, sonic line shape, and pressure distributionfurthermore, the pressure distribution so determined can then be
used for the study of heat transfer, materials behavior, and other
surface phenomenathus, for these bodies, the prandtl boundary-layer
concept can be utilized for the calculation of both the
inviscid flow and the boundary-layer behaviorit is the purpose of this note to point out that this concept can
also be applied experimentally in order to provide, in conjunction
withconventional hypersonic wind-tunnel air supply,means for investigating hypersonic heat transfer and surface
phenomena under conditions of flight reynolds numbers .on the prediction of mixed subsonic/supersonic pressure
high-speed wind-tunnel results are analyzed to derivesemiempirical
scheme for the prediction of transonic pressure distributionsthe supersonic and subsonic parts of the flow are
treated separately, and then linked by an empirical shock pressure
rise relationthe significance of the empirical results is
considered in relation to the physical mechanism of transonic
flowsit is also shown that theoretical solutions can be improved
by introducing the empirical shock relation .on the flow ofsonic stream past an airfoil surfacethis study of the flow about an airfoil innear-sonic stream
indicates the important factors determining the pressure distribution
on the airfoilanalysis of the mach wave pattern
suggests that the supersonic domain of the flow can be derived
from two simple-wave flows, one arising from the mach waves
reflected at the sonic line and the other from the changes in airfoil
surface slopethe compressive effect of the reflected mach
waves is determined quantitatively asfunction of airfoil leading-edge
geometry from an analysis of measured pressure distributions
for uncambered airfoils,. and it is shown how this can
be superimposed on the wave system from the curved surface to
give an equivalent simple-wave flow over the airfoilan application of this scheme to the calculation of the pressure
distribution over an airfoil insonic stream gives results in good
agreement with experiment .experiments on boundary layer transition at supersonic
tests were conducted in the 12-in. continuous supersonic wind
tunnel of the jet propulsion laboratory, california institute of
technology, to determine the effects of surface cooling on
boundary-layer transition at supersonic speedsthe effects of
cooling were investigated at test section mach numbers of 1.97,
smooth cone in the presence of three levels of supply-stream turbulence
(0.4, 2, andper cent) and several single-element roughnesses
at fixed axial locationtransition data were obtained
optically by means ofmagnified-schlieren systemthe results,
for the range of mach number investigated, indicate that (1)
transition onsmooth cone can definitely be delayed by surface
cooling, (2) transition promoted by either supply-stream turbulence
or surface roughness can also be delayed by surface cooling
depending upon degree of turbulence or relative roughness respectively,
and (3) the adverse effects of increased turbulence and
roughness decrease with increasing mach number .on transition experiments at moderate supersonic speedsstudies of transition overflat plate at mach number 1.76
were carried out usinghot-wire anemometer as one of the
principal toolsthe nature and measurements of free-stream
disturbances at supersonic speeds are analyzedthe experimental
results are interpreted in the light of present overall information
on transition at supersonic speeds and conclusions as
to further fruitful experiments are drawn .the gyroscopic effect ofrigid rotating propeller
in many wing vibration analyses it is found necessary to take
into account the effect of flexibly mounted engineshence,
it is reasonable to ask what vibratory gyroscopic effect this flexibility
may give rise to when propellers are whirlingan engine
mount may be thought of ashorizontal beam cantilevered
from the wing, having both horizontal and vertical flexibilityif this beam were infinitely rigid horizontally, then, when it
vibrated, the gyroscopic moments induced in the propeller due
to the resultant pitching motion of its axis would not produce
propeller axis yawhowever, engine-mount lateral stiffness
tical stiffness, so that gyroscopic effects will playrole as the
propeller axis undergoes pitching vibrations at the tip of the
cantilever engine mountthe purpose of this paper is to investigate
this role under the assumption that the propeller itself
isrigid discthe paper is divided into four partspart (1) deals briefly
with classical gyroscope theorypart (2) presents engine vibration
mode studies-experimental photographic techniques onmodel gyroscope mounted at the ends of two different cantilever
beamspart (3) presents the theory of the coupled motion of
an elastic wing upon whichgyroscope is mounted to simulate
an engine-propeller system on an airplanepart (4) consists
of an example of the theory of part (3), in which, by taking
what are thought to be reasonable parameters, results are obtained
showing how the whirling ofrigid propeller may materially
affect wing normal mode shapes and frequencies .the relation between wall temperature and the effect
the experimentally demonstrated rise and subsequent
fall of transition reynolds number with decreasing wall-toambient
temperature ratio has been the subject of two recent
notesin both cases it was argued that the increased effectiveness
of roughness due to wall cooling was not sufficient to explain
the transition-reversal phenomenon on nominally smooth

there is, at present, considerable interest in the characteristies
of blunted bodies from both an aerodynamic andheat-transfer standpointthe use of blunt shapes is contemplated
to reduce the heat-transfer problem at body noses, but
there are also applications for blunt noses which occur from
mainly aerodynamic considerationsan actual reduction in
drag may be the beneficial result of blunting the nose ofcone
orsimilar slender shape under certain conditionsalthough
the sphere has received considerable treatment, the nose shapes
are not necessarily tangent spheresin the case, let us say, oftotal head tube situated in the nose ofgiven body, the blunting
may be quite flat, and nose sections blunter than spherical shape
may conceivably be desirable, in some cases, from the heattransfer
standpointthe purpose of the present investigation is to examine the
aerodynamic effect ofsimple type of nose blunting onbasic

to take into account the effect of free convection, whenbody forceper unit mass is acting in the negative x-direction
parallel to the wallthe fluid is assumed to be semi-incompressible
as usualin addition to the obvious practical significance,
this problem is also interesting in the sense that it provides
another exact solution of the magnetohydrodynamic

pictures of the fluctuations of the free shear layer, and
studies of the diffusion of heat from sources placed in the separated
regionthe second part describes measurements of local
heat transfer to the wallthe external mach number, the length-to-depth ratio of the
cavity, the ratio of the oncoming boundary layer thickness to the

the reader certain facts that shed new light on this important problemit is shown here that the situation is not as hopeless as the abovementioned
authors intimate .analysis of low-aspect-ratio aircraft structurestwo methods are presented for the analysis of complex lowaspect-ratio
aircraft structuresboth methods provide for
arbitrary external loading, are general with respect to the orientation
of structural members, and permit arbitrary boundary
conditionsfor purposes of analysisstructure is idealized asnetwork of flexural members with interconnected torsion boxesin the first method, sets of linear equations are obtained by
expressing boundary conditions, member deflection equations,
equilibrium requirements, and slope-compatibility relationships
in terms of deflections and internal forcesthe solution for
deflections and internal forces is then formed as the product of an
inverse structural matrix andcolumn matrix of load functionsin the second method, the conditions atgiven boundary are
assembled ascolumn matrix and are transferred instep-bystep
fashion over the entire structure to an opposite boundarythe transfer is accomplished by successive multiplications of
square matrices composed independently for the different transfer
rangesthe final operation is the inversion ofrelatively
small matrix and provides the solution for the unknown boundary

differ significantly from the corresponding values obtained
directly from the cone tablesthe differences in the magnitudes
of the flow variables computed by the two methods tend to
increase with increasing free-stream mach number, cone angle

an analysis is presented which enables the temperature profiles,
veiocity profiles, heat transfer, and skin friction to be calculated
for laminar flow overtwo-dimensional or axially symmetric
surface without pressure gradient but with an arbitrary analytic
distribution of surface temperaturethe general theory is
applicable togas of any prandtl number, although the numerical
results given herein have been computed for airthe predictions of the theory for the special case of constant surface
temperature are compared with the calculations of croccoon the basis of this comparison, it is inferred that the present
theory enables heat-transfer and skin-friction calculations accurate
to within aboutper cent to be made for flight conditions
up to mach numbers nearand to within aboutorper cent
for supersonic wind-tunnel conditions up to considerably higher
mach numbersa particular effort has been made to present the results, which
are simple considering their generality, inform that can be used
readily in practical applicationsfrom the mathematical point
of view, the theory is applicable to an arbitrary analytic distribution
of surface temperature, but in any given practical case it is
necessary that the surface-temperature distribution be approximated
bypolynomialthe only unknowns in the final equations
developed are the coefficients of this polynomial, so that the
work involved in applying the theory in any given case depends
entirely on the work involved in approximatinggiven surfacetemperature
distribution bypolynomialan example is worked out in detail which illustrates some of the
principal effects of variable surface temperatureit is shown
that both positively infinite and negatively infinite heat-transfer
coefficients can occurthe anomaly of infinite and negative
heat-transfer coefficients is discussed and attributed to the customary
definition of the heat-transfer coefficient, which is shown
to be fundamentally inappropriate for flows with variable surface
temperaturein the particular example considered,conventional
method for calculating the net heat transferred yields completely
incorrect resultsa brief qualitative discussion of the
possible effects of the heat transfer on flow separation is givenin order to facilitate the use of the results, all of the principal
equations developed are collected and summarized in the section
entitled /practical use of results ./investigation of laminar boundary layer in compressible
in the present investigation of the flow of air inthin laminar
boundary layer onflat plate, the crocco method has been used to solve
the simultaneous differential equations of momentum and energy involved
in such flowthe crocco method was used because it gave accurate
results for arbitrary prandtl number near unitythe prandtl number
was taken at 0.75, the specific heat was held constant, and the
sutherland law of viscosity-temperature variation was assumed to
represent the viscosity data starting with an initial ambient
temperature of -67.6.  the main results presented here are the skinfriction
and heat-transfer coefficients as functions of reynolds number,
mach number, and wall-to-free-stream temperature ratiovariations of

constructed at the same temperature as the aircraftexternal loads will be similar to those of the aircraftsubjected to heating and cooling that correctly simulate the aerodynamic
heating of the aircraft, except with respect to angular velocities and
angular accelerations, without requiring determination of the heat flux
at each point on the surface and its variation with timeacting on the aerodynamically heated structural model to those acting
on the aircraft is determined for the case of zero angular velocity and
zero angular acceleration, so that the structural model may be subjected
to the external loads required for simultaneous simulation of stresses
and deformations due to external loads .procedure for calculating flutter at high supersonicmethod which may be used at high supersonic mach numbers is
described for calculating the flutter speed of wings having camber in

separation) between 60,000 and 400,000,
and ratios of wall temperature to
adiabatic wall temperature between 0.35 and 1.0within the range of the
present tests, the transition reynolds number was observed to decrease
with increasing wall cooling, increase with increasing mach number, and
increase with increasing unit reynolds numberthe wall-cooling effect
was found to be four times as great when the attached boundary layer
upstream of separation was cooled in conjunction with cooling of the
separated boundary layer as when only the separated boundary layer was
cooledwall cooling of both the
attached and separated flow regions also
caused, in some cases, reattachment in the otherwise separated regioncavity resonance present in the separated region for some model configurations
was accompanied bylarge decrease in transition reynolds

the location of the separation point in an adverse pressure gradient,short and simple method, based on the use ofseventh-degree velocity
profile, is derivedthe numerical example given here indicates that
this method should in practice lead to sufficiently accurate resultsfor the special case of flow nearforward stagnation point it is shown

on the wall temperature required for complete stabilization of the
laminar boundary layer, and on the minimum critical reynolds number for

similarity rule with sufficient accuracy for most engineering purposesthe error introduced into pressure distributions and drag of ogive
cylinders by ignoring the rotation term in the characteristic equations
is investigatedit is found that
the influence of the rotation term on
pressure distribution and drag depends only upon the similarity parameter(mach number divided by fineness ratio)although the error in
drag, due to neglect of the rotation term, is negligible at k=0.5, the
error is about 30 percent at k=2.0charts are presented for the rapid determination of pressure
distributions for rotational flow over
ogive cylinders for all values of

temperatures and thermal stresses in typical skin-stiffener combinations
of winglike structures subjected to aerodynamic heating have
been obtained with the aid of an electronic differential analyzervariations were made in an aerodynamic
heat-transfer parameter, injoint
conductivity parameter, and in the ratio
of skin width to skin thicknessthe results, which are presented in nondimensional form, indicate that
decreasing the joint conductivity parameter lowers both the interior
and the average temperature ratios, increases the peak thermal stress
ratios in the skin, and may considerably increase the peak stiffener
stress ratios,. increasing the aerodynamic heat-transfer parameter
decreases the interior and average temperature ratios, increases the
peak skin stress ratios somewhat,
but greatly increases the peak stiffener
stress ratios,. and increasing the ratio of skin width to skin
thickness produces only moderate decreases in the peak skin stress
ratios while moderately increasing the peak stiffener stress ratios .dynamic stability of vehicles traversing ascending

correlation appears to exist between the drag-divergence mach number
and the free-stream mach number for which sonic velocity occurs at the
airfoil crest, the chordwise station at which the airfoil surface is
tangent to the free-stream directionit was found that, since the
mach number for which sonic velocity occurs at the airfoil crest can be
estimated satisfactorily by means of the prandtl-glauert rule,method
is provided whereby the drag-divergence mach number of an airfoil
section atgiven angle of attack can be estimated from the low-speed
pressure distribution and the airfoil profilethis method was used
to predict withreasonable degree of accuracy the drag-divergence
mach number ofconsiderable number of airfoil sections having diverse
shapes andwide range of thickness-chord ratiosthe pressure distributions and section force characteristics of

accurate for strong expansion wavesthe laminar-boundary-layer problem was solved by numerical integration
except for the weak wave case,
which can be solved analyticallyintegral (karman-pohlhausen type)
solutions were also obtained to provideguide for determining expressions
which accurately represent the numerical
dataanalytical expressions
for various boundary-layer parameters
are presented which agree with the
numerical integrations withinpercentthe turbulent-boundary-layer problem was solved using integral methods
similar to those employed for the
solution of turbulent compressible

utilized inform which accounted for compressibilityconsideration of the heat transfer to the wall permitted the wall

in the present report the stability of two-dimensional laminar
flows ofgas is investigated by the method of small perturbationsthe chief emphasis is placed on the case of the laminar boundary layerpartof the present report deals with the general mathematical
theorythe general equations governing one normal mode of the small
velocity and temperature disturbances are derived and studied in great
detailit is found that for reynolds numbers of the order of those
encountered in most aerodynamic problems, the temperature disturbances
have onlynegligible effect on those particular velocity solutions
which depend primarily on the viscosity coefficient (/viscous solutions/)indeed, the latter are actually of the same form in the
compressible fluid as in the incompressible fluid, at least to the first
approximationbecause of this fact, the mathematical analysis is
greatly simplifiedthe final equation determining the characteristic
values of the stability problem depends on the /inviscid solutions/ and
the function of tietjens inmanner very similar to the case of the incompressible
fluidthe second viscosity coefficient and the
coefficient of heat conductivity do not enter the problem,. only the
ordinary coefficient of viscosity near the solid surface is involvedpartdeals with the limiting case of infinite reynolds numbersthe study of energy relations is very much emphasizedit is shown
that the disturbance will gain energy from the main flow if the gradient
of the product of mean density and mean vorticity near the solid surface
hassign opposite to that near the outer edge of the boundary layera general stability criterion has been obtained in terms of the
gradient of the product of density and vorticity, analogous to the
rayleigh-tollmien criterion for the case of an incompressible fluidif this gradient vanishes for some value of the velocity ratio of the
main flow exceeding 1-1/m (whereis the free stream mach number) .an experimental study of the turbulen coundary layer

is given along with data pertaining to the acoustic inputs from
some powerplants in common usecomparisons are given for results of
some fatigue tests of flat panels and cantilever beams exposed to both
random- and discrete-type inputsin this regard it appears that both
the stress level of the test and the type of model are significant,.
hence, no generalization can be made at this timewith regard to
increasing the fatigue life, it was noted that increased stiffening ofpanel due to curvature and pressure differential is particularly
beneficial .flight measurement of wall pressure fluctuations and
the results are presented forflight test program usingfighter
type jet aircraft flying at pressure altitudes of 10,000, 20,000, and
apparatus was used to measure and record the output of microphones and
hot-wire anemometers mounted on the forward-fuselage section and wing of
the airplanemean-velocity profiles in the boundary layers were
obtained from total-pressure measurementsthe ratio of the root-mean-square fluctuating wall pressure to the
free-stream dynamic pressure is presented asfunction of reynolds number
and mach numberthe longitudinal
component of the turbulent-velocity
fluctuations was measured, and the turbulence-intensity profiles are
presented for the wing and forward-fuselage sectionin general, the results are in agreement with wind-tunnel measurements
which have been reported in the literaturefor example, the
variation of (is the root mean square of the wall-pressure
fluctuation, andis the free-stream dynamic pressure) with reynolds
number was found to be essentially constant for the forward-fuselagesection
boundary layer, while variations at the wing station were probably
unduly affected by the microphone diameter, which was
large compared with the boundary-layer thickness .a comparative analysis of the performance of long range
long-range hypervelocity vehicles are studied in terms of their
motion in powered flight, and their motion and aerodynamic heating in
unpowered flightpowered flight is
analyzed for an idealized propulsion
system which rather closely approaches
present-day rocket motorsunpowered
flight is characterized byreturn
to earth alongballistic, skip,
or glide trajectoryonly those
trajectories are treated which yield the
maximum range forgiven velocity at the end of powered flightaerodynamic
heating is treated inmanner
similar to that employed previously
by the senior authors in studying ballistic missiles (naca tn 4047),
with the exception that radiant as well as convective heat transfer is
considered in connection with glide and skip vehiclesthe ballistic vehicle is found to be the least efficient of the
several types studied in the sense
that it generally requires the highest
velocity at the end of powered flight in order to attaingiven rangethis disadvantage may be offset, however, by reducing convective heat
transfer to the re-entry body through
the artifice of increasing pressure
drag in relation to friction dragthat
is, by usingblunt bodythus
the kinetic energy required by the vehicle at the end of powered flight
may be reduced by minimizing the mass of coolant material involvedthe glide vehicle developing lift-drag ratios in the neighborhood
of and greater thanis far superior
to the ballistic vehicle in ability
to convert velocity into rangeit has the disadvantage of having far
more heat convected to it,. however, it has the compensating advantage
that this heat can in the main be radiated
back to the atmosphereconsequently,
the mass of coolant material may be kept relatively lowthe skip vehicle developing lift-drag ratios from abouttois
found to be superior to comparable ballistic and glide vehicles in converting
velocity into rangeat
lift-drag ratios belowit is found to
be about equal to comparable ballistic
vehicles while at lift-drag ratiosan analytical treatment of aircraft propeller precession
an analytical investigation is made ofprecession-type instability
which can occur inflexibly supported aircraft-engine-propeller combinationby means of an idealized
mathematical model which is comprised
ofrigid power-plant system flexibly
mounted in pitch and yaw tofixed
backup structure, the conditions required for neutral stability are
determinedthe paper also examines the sensitivity of the stability
boundaries to changes in such parameters
as stiffness, damping, and asymmetries
in the engine mount, propeller
speed, airspeed, mach number, propeller
thrust, and location of pitch and yaw axesstability is found
to depend strongly on the damping and stiffness in the systemwith the use of nondimensional charts theoretical stability boundaries
are compared with experimental results obtained in wind-tunnel
tests of an aeroelastic airplane modelin general, the theoretical
results, which do not account for wing response, show the same trends
as observed experimentally,. however,
forgiven set of conditions calculated
airspeeds for neutral stability
are consistently lower than the
measured valuesevidently, this result is due to the fact that wing
response tends to add damping to the system .effects of extreme surface cooling on boundary layer
an investigation was made to determine the combined effects of surface
cooling, pressure gradients, nose blunting, and surface finish on
boundary-layer transitiondata were obtained for various body shapes
atmach number of 3.12 and reynolds
numbers per foot as high as 15x10previous transition studies, with moderate cooling, have shown agreement
with the predictions of stability theoryfor surface roughnesses
ranging fromto 1250 microinches the location of transition was unaffected
with moderate coolingwith extreme cooling, an adverse effect
was observed for each of the parameters investigatedin general, the
transition reynolds number decreased with
decreasing surface temperaturein particular, the beneficial effects offavorable pressure gradient
obtained with moderate cooling disappear with extreme cooling, andtransition reynolds number lower than
that observed oncone is obtainedfurther, an increase in the nose bluntness decreased the transition
reynolds number under conditions of extreme cooling .effect of distributed three-dimensional roughness and
an investigation was made in the langleyby 4-foot supersonic
pressure tunnel at mach numbers of 1.61 and 2.01 to determine (1) the
effect of distributed roughness on boundary-layer transition with the
model surface at adiabatic wall temperature and cooled and (2) the
effect of surface cooling on the lateral spread of turbulenceboth
distributed granular-type and single spherical roughness particles were
used, and transition of the boundary layer was determined by hot-wire
anemometersthe transition-triggering mechanism of the threedimensional
roughness at supersonic speeds appeared to be the same as
that previously observed at subsonic speedsin fact, the critical
value of the roughness reynolds number parameter (that is,
the value at which turbulent spots are initiated by the roughness) was
found to be approximately the same at supersonic and subsonic speeds
when complete local conditions at the top of the roughness, including
density and viscosity, were considered in the formulation of the roughness
reynolds numberfor three-dimensional roughness atreynolds
number less than its critical value, the roughness introduced no disturbances
of sufficient magnitude to influence transitionsurface
cooling, although providingtheoretical increase in stability to small
disturbances, did not increase to any important extent the value of the
critical roughness reynolds number for three-dimensional roughness particlescooling, therefore, because of its effect on the boundarylayer
thickness, density, and viscosity actually promoted transition due
to existing three-dimensional surface roughness for given mach and
reynolds numbersthe measured lateral spread of turbulence in the
boundary layer appeared to be unaffected by the increased laminar
stability derived from the surface cooling .compressible laminar flow and heat transfer aboutthe flow and heat transfer aboutrotating isothermal disk are reexamined
to include the effects of compressibility and property variationsif viscous dissipation is neglected,
the compressible problem is
correlated to the incompressible problem by assuming linear variations
of viscosity and thermal conductivity with temperaturecertain inaccuracies
in several previous incompressible solutions are noted and
corrected hereinthe effect of compressibility appears asdistortion of the normal coordinate and normal velocity component and asmultiplicative factor in the heat-transfer coefficient, the nusselt
number, and in the expressions for the skin-friction components and
torque required to rotate the disk .theoretical investigation of the ablation ofglass-type
the melting-type heat protection at the stagnation point ofre-entering irbm is treated by employing homogeneous, opaque, and
nondecomposing glass shields which do not exceedtemperature of
some effects due to variations of the glass propertiesthe ballistic
re-entry vehicle hasnose diameter of 0.635 m,ballistic factor
of 3.510,re-entry angle of 124.9 (from the
vertical) at an altitude of 100 km, andre-entry speed of 4.5the performance of 36 different glass shields with assumed
combinations of material properties is investigated by employingcalculation method which yields practically exact, transient solutions
for the problemascorollary, results forcertain steady flight
state are also giventhe discussions made it possible to derive
under realistic flight conditions some thermal characteristics for the
employment of thin, or light-weight, glass shieldsinvestigation of these hypothetical glass shields leads to the
conclusion thatlow thermal conductivity andhigh specific heat,
and thus,small thermal diffusivity are most desirablea small
thermal diffusivity yields high surface temperatures, causinghigh
radiative heat transfer out of the shield,. and steep temperature profiles
normal to the surface, causingsmall thermal penetration across
the shield with little total ablation of the shieldresults show that
for the assumed irbm re-entry, the necessary thickness of the employed
glass shields increases monotonically with thermal diffusivity which is
the only material parameter affecting this thicknessa high viscosity level andhigh emissivity constant of the surface
of the supposedly opaque shield are also desirable,. although,
these two properties exertcomparatively small influence on the
overall performance when disregarding glass shields with an extremely
low viscosity level .discussion of solar proton events and manned space
asresult of studies made during the
international geophysical year (igy) and the
international geophysical cooperation (igc),
it is known thatconsiderable fraction of
large solar flares give rise to almost pure
streams of protons which reach the earth and
continue to arrive for as long as 11 daysthe energies of these particles lie withinvery steep spectrum extending from 20 to
least 500 mevbecause of the frequency
of large flares during times of high solar activity,
and owing to the long duration of each
solar proton emission, these particles were
present in detectable intensity near the top
of the earth's atmosphere for about 15 percent
of the time from 1957 to 1960the number
of large flares that accelerated and released
these particles during this three-year period was about 30the event that began on august 22, 1958
contributed greatly toward the understanding
of the solar and terrestrial sequence of events,
and in addition provided the first identification
of the emitted particlesa flare on may
of protons in the neighborhood of the earth that
this phenomenon was recognized as an
additional radiation hazard to manned vehicles
in the high atmosphere and in most parts
of the solar systemthe three very intense
events that occurred in july, 1959 further
supported this conclusion, and the possibility
of predicting such events became an important
considerationin addition to its value
in the protection of human beings, effective
forecasting clearly would be of great value in
the detailed scientific study of this phenomenonthis paper presentspreliminary
discussion of some aspects of predicting the
arrival of protons at the earth following the
appearance of solar activity features and,
equally important, of forecasting the periods
when this penetrating radiation is unlikely
to occur .experimental investigation of the downstream influence
this report presents the results of an experimental investigation
of the downstream influence of localized mass transfer in the
stagnation region ofblunt body under hypersonic flow conditionsthe coolant is injected throughporous plug coaxial
with the centerline of symmetry of the modelthe tests were
carried out inwind tunnel withmach number of 6.0, stagnation
temperatures of approximately 1,600 r., andstagnation
pressure of approximately 600 psiafour different gases were
injected overrange of mass flowsthe heat transfer on the impermeable
section was measured under isothermal wall conditions,.
for the higher rates of mass flow, adiabatic surface temperatures
were also determinedthe theoretical analysis of the
boundary-layer flow is investigated in order to establish the similarity
parameters for the flow systemthese parameters permit
the extrapolation of the test results to other flow conditions,
provided that laminar flow prevailshelium is found to be the
most efficacious coolant .on trails of axisymmetric hypersonic blunt bodies flying
the trail left in the atmosphere bybody moving at hypersonic
speeds is the subject of theoretical treatmentthe times required
for ionization and dissociation (and their inverse processes)
to go to completion, when compared to the flow times ofgas
particle, are important in determining the observable effects of
hypersonic trails-i.e., emitted thermal radiation and reflection
of electromagnetic waves from the trailin order to simplify the theoretical treatment, the trail is
divided into two regions ..  (1) the expansion-controlled trail,
which treats the behavior of the wake behind the body up topoint, along the direction of flight, where the pressure decays to
the free-stream value and cooling is controlled principally by the
expansion of the flow, and (2) the conduction-controlled trail,
where the trail cools mainly by diffusion of heat away from the
high-temperature corethe influence of the details of the body shape on the observables
are discussed andsimple computational procedure for
the behavior of the conduction-controlled trail is developed based
on integral methodsresults of calculations that assume thermodynamic
equilibrium of the flow field give the values of the
thermodynamic variables in the trail ofsphere, axial distributions
of emitted thermal radiation, and maps of electron density
distributionit is shown that the cooling of the conductioncontrolled
trail is essentially due to conduction of heat and that
viscous effects are not importantit is found that this portion
of the trail does not widen as one proceeds downstreamflight
velocities considered vary between 15,000 and 35,000 ft sec and
altitudes range between 100,000 and 250,000 ft .inviscid-incompressible flow theory of static peripheral

made in obtainingsolution of the governing inviscid, twodimensional
hydrodynamical flow equationsthe results are
valid for all jet thickness vehicle height ratiosthe limit of
applicability of existing theories (very low thickness height
ratios) are definedjet reaction, lift, and power coefficients for

and lift power ratios are also calculatedapplications to three-dimensional vehicles with rotational
symmetry are indicated .free-convection magnetohydrodynamic flow pastporous flat platethe incompressible flow of an electrically conducting fluid pastporous
plate with constant suction velocity in the presence oftransverse
uniform strength has recently been investigated by guptain
this note, the problem is generalized to take into account the effect of
free convection, whenbody force is acting parallel to the wallthe
fluid is assumed to be semi-incompressible as usualin addition to
the obvious practical significance, this problem is also interesting in
the sense that it provides another exact solution of the magnetohydrodynamic
equations, since the only electromagnetic assumptions involved
are constant properties and freedom from excessive charges .magnetohydrodynamic free-convection pipe flowit has been shown that transverse magnetic fields of practical
strengths exert considerable influence on liquid-metal, freeconvection,
vertical, flat-plate and parallel-plate flow fieldsthe extent of influence was determined by the magnitude ofnondimensional parameterwhich is the ratio of the hartmann
number to the fourth root of the grashof number, and ismeasure of the relative influence of the magnetic and buoyant
forcesin this note the steady, fully developed, laminar, freeconvection
flow offluid of electrical conductivity throughfully submerged, open-ended, constant-temperature, vertical
pipe located intransverse magnetic field of strength is
analyzed in terms of the same parameterthe magnitude of
its influence on the velocity and temperature profiles, the surface
shear and heat transfer, and the volumetric flow rate is determined
.an investigation of separated flows, part i: the pressure
the present article describes an investigation of several types of
separated regions such as blunt-base wakes and cavities formed
in cutouts in the boundaries and ahead of or behind two-dimensional
steps in supersonic (mach numbersto 4) and subsonic
flowthe conditions for the existence, the geometry,
and the pressure field are described in this papera second article (to be published) will describe investigations of
the internal flow and the heat transfer across such separated
regionsit is found that there ismaximum (critical) ratio of the length
of the separated free-shear layer to the depth of the depression
in the boundary beyond which the cavity collapses, leaving
mutually independent separated regions at each protrusionthis critical length changes greatly upon laminar-turbulent
transition in the oncoming boundary layer,. in either laminar or
turbulent flow it is approximately independent of mach and
reynolds numbersa semiempirical correlation predicting the
conditions under which the flow will spandepression of arbitrary
depth is proposeddetailed pressure distributions along the boundaries ofcavity (in turbulent flow) are presented asfunction of the ratio
of the cavity length to the critical length, which is found to be
the pertinent similarity parameterfor short notches
the impact pressure due to the reversal of the inner portion
of the shear layer at recompression tends to thicken the shear
layer andtype of boundary layer-free stream interaction
governs the pressure fieldthe pressure in the cavity is nearly
constant and can be higher than free-streamin long notches
the shear layer bends inward at separation and
curves back gradually ahead of the recompression pointthe
floor-pressure variation is pronounced and the recovery pressure
at reattachment is smallthe variation of the drag coefficient
with mach number reflects the change from one to the other
mechanism of recompressiondetailed surveys of the mach-number distributions inblunt-body wake and the mixing region behind its throat, as
well as in the shear layer spanningcutout inwall, are presented
and analyzedit is found that, in general, the assumptions of
the simple supersonic-wake models which rely onprinciple of
steady flow with mass conservation in the cavity are not adequate
for cavities in which there is recompression againstboundaryresults showing the influence of the thickness of the initial
boundary layer (in the range of 0.3 totimes the notch depth)
and of the geometry of the notch are also presented .periodic temperature distributions intwo-layer composite

insulating thermal barrier to protect exposed solid-propellant
motors from atmospheric or environmental temperature

study,solution was developed for the periodic temperature distribution
intwo-layer composite slabone exposed surface of
this composite slab was adiabatic, and the other exposed surface
was subjected tosinusoidal temperature variationthe technique
used in the analysis was similar to that of groberin this
note, pertinent features of the development of the solution are
given .periodic temperature distribution intwo-layer composite slabinrecent contribution to the reader's forum, under the above title,
stonecypher outlinedmethod for finding the periodic temperature distribution

being insulated and the other subject tosinusoidal temperature variationperfect thermal contact between the two layers, and constant
thermal properties were assumedtwo years agodrew attention in these pages tomethod for determining
the transient temperature in suchtwo-layer slab resulting fromtriangular heat-input pulsei should like to point out that this same
method also is applicable to the case where one external face is givensinusoidal temperature variation with timethe method is based on
the analogy between one-dimensional heat flow and the flow of an electric
current insimple transmission line having only series resistance
and parallel capacitance .the analysis of redundant structures by the use of
large-scale redundant structure analyses are currently
feasible by the use of modern high-speed digital computersthis capability opportunely meets the urgent need to solve
complex problems which otherwise would be hopelessly beyond
the capacity of the hand desk computerhowever, the difficulties
have now shifted from tedious hand computations to the problems
of adequately representing the structure bymodel and
of the peculiarities of irregular geometrical configurationsa wide scope of problem types can be handled bygeneralized
program approachmatrix formulation is used for the organization
of input data and for handling data transfer in the large
complex of subroutines, including the formation of equilibrium
and continuity conditions to the final loads and deflectionssimultaneous treatment of thermal expansions and plasticity
is includedthe use of minimum-size redundant systems is emphasized,
starting from the philosophy of cutting members to providestatically determinate structureimproved numerical accuracy
and problem size capacity is gained forgiven computerexamples are discussed ranging from simple plane-load diffusion
problems to pressurized fuselage cutouts and complex
wing-fuselage-shell intersection-type problems .the supersonic blunt body problemreview and extensionsa survey of existing analytical treatments of the supersonic or
hypersonic blunt-body problem indicates that none is adequate
for predicting the details of the flow fieldreasons are given for
the failure of various plausible approximationsa numerical
method, which is simpler than others proposed, is set forth for
solving the full inviscid equations usingmedium-sized electronic
computerresults are shown fromnumber of solutions for
bodies that support detached shock waves described by conic
sections .the transverse curvature effect in compressible axially
the viscous transverse curvature effect in compressible axially
symmetric laminar boundary-layer flow has been investigated,
and it is found that the effect is characterized by the parameter
which is essentially the ratio of the boundary-layer thickness
to body radiusit is shown that the busemann and crocco
integrals of the two-dimensional energy equation for are
still valid for axially symmetric flow in which the transverse
curvature effects are consideredbygeneralization of mangler's
transformation it is then shown that the boundary-layer
equations are reducible to an almost two-dimensional form, making
the analysis simpler for two asymptotic flow regions characterized
by and less than or of the order of unityit is with the latter region that the present paper is primarily
concerned, and for this case it is shown that the additional term
in the momentum and energy equations, which differentiates them
from the two-dimensional form, behaves like an external favorable
pressure gradientexcept for certain special cases it is necessary to obtain the
of the order of unity by means of asymptotic expansions in
ascending powers ofparameter that is small compared to unity
but proportional toit is shown how the asymptotic solutions
can be found for (1) the velocity and temperature distributions
for the compressible zero pressure gradient case when the
body shapes are given by and and (2) the velocity
distribution for incompressible flow with an external velocity
of the form pastbody given bythe
zeroth approximation is the mangler resultfor the cases oflinear external velocity distribution, similar profiles can be found
for all values ofmore generally it is shown that similar
profiles exist if the exponentsandsatisfy the condition thathere, similar is used in the restricted meaning
that the distributions are derivable from ordinary differential
equationsin the case of the cone and cylinder with zero pressure gradient
where the equations have been numerically integrated for,
the first-order correction to the mangler formulation shows that
the effect on both the skin-friction coefficient and heat-transfer
rate can become appreciable in the range where is less than
or of the order of unityatconstant, the effects are increased
in magnitude when either the ratio of wall to free-stream
temperature, or mach number, is increasedalso, all other
conditions being equal, for the same value of the skin-friction
coefficient and heat-transfer increase on the cylinder is greater
than that on the conefor flows with pressure gradient, the transverse curvature term
behaves again likefavorable pressure gradient and tends to
delay both separation and transition when compared with axially
symmetric flows in which the transverse curvature effect is neglected
.temperature distribution and thermal stresses inthe transient temperature distribution and the thermal
stresses in an idealized wing structure considered by hoff and
torda in referenceare determinedonly the effects of aerodynamic
heating and of heat conduction are included,. radiation
and convection effects are neglectedthe present work differs
from that of referencein that the conduction from the cap to
the web is considered when the temperature of the cap is calculated,
and the spar cap temperature is assumed to befunction
of both space and timegraphs of temperature and thermal
stress distributions are presented, and the results are compared
with those of reference.review of published data on the effect of roughness on transition fromreview is presented of the published data on the effect of roughness,
especially single roughness elements, on transition from laminar to turbulent
flow, in which an attempt is made to reanalyze and correlate the
available informationthe reanalysis shows that the transition
reynolds number offlat plate with zero pressure gradient isfunction
of the ratio of the height of the roughness element to the displacement
thickness of the boundary layer at the element, this functional relation
beingbetter representation of the data thanconstant critical
reynolds number of the roughness elementother data show that the
effects of roghness are similar in streams of different initial turbulence
and thatplot of the ratio of transition reynolds number of the
rough plate to that for the smooth plate against the ratio of the height
of the roughness element to displacement thickness of the boundary layer
at the element gives good correlation of all the data forgiven shape
when transition occurs downstream from the
roughness elementatcertain value of the height-thickness ratio
dependent on the stream speed, location of roughness element, and airstream
turbulence, the transition position reaches the element and remains
there as the height or the stream speed is further increasedthe paper also discusses available data on the effect of distributed
roughness on transition onflat plate, as well as some of the published
data on roughness effects on transition on air-foils .a mixing theory for the interaction between dissipative
by means ofsimplified theoretical /model,/ the present paper
treats the general class of flow problems characterized by the
interaction betweenviscous or dissipative flow near the surface
ofsolid body, or in its wake, and an /outer/ nearly isentropic
streamfor the present, the external flow is taken to beplane,
steady, supersonic flow, which makessmall angle withplane
surface or plane of symmetry, although the methods used can be
extended to curved surfaces, to axially symmetric supersonic
flows, and also to subsonic flowsthe internal dissipative flow
is regarded as quasi-one-dimensional and parallel to the surface
on the average, withproperly defined mean velocity and mean
temperaturethe nonuniformity of the actual velocity distribution
is taken into account only approximately by means ofrelation between mean temperature and mean velocitymixing,
or the transport of momentum from outer stream to dissipative
flow, is considered to be the fundamental physical process
determining the pressure rise that can be supported by the flowwith the aid of this concept,large number of flow problems is
shown to be basically similar, such as boundary-layer-shockwave
interaction, wake flow behind blunt-based bodies (base
pressure problem), flow separation in overexpanded supersonic
nozzles, separation on wings and bodies, etc .heat transfer by laminar flow torotating platean exact solution of the heat-transfer problem for the von
karman example of the laminar flow ofviscous fluid overrotating plate is given in dimensionless form and physically discussedthe solution is explicitly given forconstant temperature
on the plate with viscous dissipation includedthe numerical
results are given for prandtl numbers from 0.5 to 10 .the fundamentals of the statistical theory of turbulencestatistical theory in general considers mean values of certain quantitiesin the case of the turbulent motion one is interested in mean
values of velocities and of their derivatives, and in mean values of
squares and products of velocities and their derivativesit was o.
reynolds who first expressed the so-called apparent or turbulent stresses
by the mean values of the products of the velocity componentsthe
different theories suggested so far have as their common objective the
establishment of relations between certain mean values, e.g. between the
turbulent shear stresses given by the mean products of velocity fluctuations
and the derivatives of the mean velocities, i.e. the measured mean
velocity gradientsin this sort of investigations the conception of
the /correlation/ is of paramount importancethe late a. friedman
tried to introduce the correlations as unknown variables in the hydrodynamic
equations., however, he could not carry his investigations to
practical results, i.e., to results which can be compared with the experimental
evidencerecently, g. i. taylor had success in his analysis
of /isotropic/ turbulence by means of correlation calculations, and
was able to discuss, theoretically, the problem of the decay of turbulence
inwindstream behindturbulence producing devicehis theory
raised considerable interest because it is concerned with the important
problem of wind-tunnel turbulence and its results could be compared
directly with experimental work done by dryden in this country and by
fage, townend and simmons in englandthe present paper is concerned with two fundamental problems.. with
uniform isotropic turbulence and with the turbulent friction inparallel
streamfirst, the general theory of isotropic turbulence is developedthis general theory includes taylor's consideration asspecial
casehowever, itvibration isolation of aircraft power plantsvibration in aircraft structure can almost
always be traced to vibratory forces originating
from the power plantthese forces are transmitted
to the aircraft in two ways ..  (1) by the action of air
forces upon the surfaces of the aircraft in, or adjacent
to, the slip stream of the propeller, and (2) by direct
transmission of unbalanced forces from the power
plant through the engine mountingthe latter has
always caused the preponderance of disturbancevibratory stresses induced in the engine mounting
structure occasionally produce fatigue failures in the
associated parts, and always shorten the useful life
of the entire aircraft structuremore important,
however, are the psychological and physiological
effects of continuous vibration and its attendant noise
on the passengers and crewthis may very likely
be the major source of the rapid fatigue which is so
intimately associated with flyingthe importance
and desirability of drastically reducing vibration can
hardly be questionedthis paper is limited toconsideration of the directly
transmitted forces and, further, considers the
power plants as rigid bodies attached by flexible means
to the aircraft which is also considered asrigid body
of relatively large massit is also limited to the case
of engines and engine supporting structures having
axial symmetry (radial engines), although the methods
employed could easily be extended to other cases .laminar heat transfer over blunt-nosed bodies at hypersonic flight
this paper deals with two limiting cases of laminar heat transfer over
blunt-nosed bodies at hypersonic flight speeds, or high stagnation temperatures..
 (a) thermodynamic equilibrium, in which the chemical reaction
rates are regarded as /very fast/ compared to the rates of diffusion
across streamlines., (b) diffusion as rate-governing, in which the volume
recombination rates within the boundary layer are /very slow/ compared
to diffusion across streamlinesin either case the gas density
near the surface ofblunt-nosed body is much higher than the density
just outside the boundary layer, and the velocity and stagnation enthalpy
profiles are much less sensitive to pressure gradient than in the
more familiar case of moderate temperature differencesin fact, in
case (a), the nondimensionalized enthalpy gradient at the surface is
represented very accurately by the /classical/ zero pressure gradient
value, and the surface heat-transfer rate distribution is obtained directly
in terms of the surface pressure distributionin order to
illustrate the method, this solution is applied to the special cases
of an unyawed hemisphere and an unyawed, blunt cone capped byspherical
segmentin the opposite limiting case where diffusion is rate-controlling the
diffusion equation for each species is reduced to the same form as the
low-speed energy equation, except that the prandtl number is replaced
by the schmidt numberthe simplifications introduced in case (a) are
also applicable here, and the expression for surface heat transfer rate
is similar., the maximum value of the ratio between the rate of heat
transfer by diffusion alone and by heat conduction alone in the case of
thermodynamic equilibrium is given by..  (prandtl no./schmidt no .)
when the diffusion coefficient is estimated by takingreasonable value
of atom-molecule collision cross section this ratio is 1.30additional
theoretical and (especially) experimental studies are clearly required
before these simple results are accepted .advantages and limitations of modelssummary ..  the use of models for structural test investigations in the
presence of kinetic heating effects is examinedthe principal
features of the complex process to be
represented are discussed under the classifications
external air flow, internal heat transfer,
elastic responseof these the second is found
to influence most model design, and an
analysis oftypical structure is included to
illustrate the various contributions to
internal heat transfer .theory of mixing and chemical reaction in the opposed
an idealization of the flow system used by potter
and butler is analyzedthe differential equation
of mixing is solved exactly, to give the location
of, and burning rate in, the flamethe solutions
to the chemical kinetic differential equation
are discussed, relations being derived between the jet
flow rate at extinction, the chemical kinetic
constants and the laminar flame speed in premixed
gasesit is shown that the jet flow rate at
extinction is independent of the transport propertiescomparison is made with the experimental
data of potter, heimel and butlerit is argued that
experiments must be carried out at higher
reynolds numbers if the measurements are to be quantitatively
analyzable .similar solutions offree convection boundary layer
author investigates the existence ofclass of similar solutions
for free convection fromvertical flat plate, such as are known for
free convection innonconducting fluidthe magnetic field acts
transversely to the fluid motion and is assumed to remain constant
in the direction perpendicular to the platethis introduces into
the momentum equationretarding force which isfunction only
of x, the distance along the plate lengthfor similarity it is
found that the magnetic inductance must vary asif
the plate temperature is constantif= 0, the magnetic inductance
is constant while the plate temperature increases linearly
with.the asymptotic boundary layer oncircular cylinder
in this paper the incompressible boundary layer overcircular cylinder in an axial flow is investigated far from the
leading edgeifandare the velocity components in theanddirection respectively andstream function is
introduced by and, then
forconstant free-stream velocity has the following
asymptotic form ..
where the p's are determined successively, first for s=1 and
all t, then s=2 and all t, etc., from ordinary differential equationshere and log c=euler's
constantit is shown that the effect of the curvature of the
body (in planes perpendicular to the flow) is to increase
the skin frictionalso the case in which the free-stream velocity
is proportional to (at the
method breaks down), is studiedit is concluded that the
effect of the curvature of the cylinder, when the boundary
layer hasthickness comparable with its radius of curvature,
is to delay separation .the transverse potential flow pastbody of revolutionit is shown that in the potential flow of
an incompressible inviscid fluid pastbody of revolution set with its axis at right
angles to the stream, the velocity components
at the surface along and perpendicular
to the meridians vary with azimuthal
angle round the body insimple mannerthis is shown by entirely elementary
considerations .on the mixing of two parallel streamsusing the techniques of boundary-layer theory, the proper third
boundary condition for the mixing of two parallel streams is derived
from the compatibility condition of the higher order approximationit is shown that the commonly adopted third boundary
condition of balancing of transverse momentum is correct only for
the mixing problem of two semi-infinite incompressible streamsfor the fulfillment of the proper third boundary condition, the
possibility of introducing the similar solution of blasius type is
examined for various cases .properties of the confluent hypergeometric functionthe confluent hypergeometric functions have proved useful in many branches
of physicsthey have been used in such problems involving diffusion
and sedimentation, as isotope separation and protein molecular
weight determinations in the ultracentrifugethe solution of the
equation for the velocity distribution of electrons in high frequency
gas discharges may frequently be expressed in terms of these functionsthe high frequency breakdown electric field may then be predicted theoretically
for gases by the use of such solutions together with kinetic
theorythis report presents some of the properties of the confluent hypergeometric
functions together with six-figure tables of the functions .the production of uniform shear flow inwind tunnela nearly uniform shear flow was obtained in the working
section ofwind tunnel by insertinggrid of parallel rods with
varying spacingthe function of suchgrid is to imposeresistance to the
flow, so graded across the working section as to producelinear

without introducing an appreciable gradient in static pressure near
the grida method of calculatingsuitable arrangement of the
rods is describedalthough this method is strictly applicable
only to weakly sheared flows, an experiment made withgrid
designed forshear parameter as large as 0.45 gave results in
close agreement with the theorythere was no evidence from
the experiment of any large-scale secondary flow accompanying
the shear--a danger inherent in an empirical attempt to grade the
resistance of the grid--nor was any tendency observed for the
shear to decay with increasing distance from the grid .dynamics ofdissociating gasthis islucid introduction to the effects of dissociation
in gas dynamicsthe problem in view is that of air flow

thermodynamics ofpure dissociating diatomic gas,new model is introducedthis /ideal dissociating gas/ is
characterized by only three constants, the characteristic
temperature, density and internal energy for dissociationphysically, it may be regarded as having its vibrational
modes always just half excited (so that at low temperatures
the ratio of specific heats approaches3 rather
then5)thermodynamic properties of the ideal gas
are derived, and the oblique shock wave relations deduced
in the /strong-shock/ approximation (including an
elegant relation between the principal curvatures of any
bow shock and the subsequent vorticity)useful relations
are given for the isentropic changes that take place along
streamlines between shocksvarious of these results are applied to the problem
typified bysphere flying at high mach numberthe
newtonian impact theory and its empirical modification
are dismissed as lacking theoretical basis, in favor of the
limit for large values of both mach number and density
ratio across the shockit is suggested that the zero surface
pressure sometimes predicted by the latter theory
corresponds to separation not of the flow but of the shock
wave from the surfacean estimate is given for the subsequent
shape of the shockfinally, another approximation
is applied to the region near the stagnation streamlinethe fluid is assumed incompressible, but rotational
in accord with the shock relations,. and it is shown thatspherical shock corresponds toconcentric spherical bodythe resulting surface pressure is withinper cent of that

this paper studies the steady
motion of an electrically conducting, viscous fluid
along channels in the presence of an imposed
transverse magnetic field when the walls do not
conduct currentsthe equations which determine
the velocity profile, induced currents and

ofrectangular channelwhen the imposed
field is sufficiently strong the velocity profile is
found to degenerate intocore of uniform flow
surrounded by boundary layers on each wallthe layers on the walls parallel to the imposed
field are ofnovel characteran analogous
degenerate solution for channels of any symmetrical
shape is developedthe predicted pressure
gradients for given volumes of flow at various field
strengths are finally compared with experimental results for square and
circular pipes .acoustical signal detection in turbulent airflowimprovement in detected signal-to-noise ratio is obtained
forperiodic signal masked by additive noise
and turbulent noise backgroundscomparisons are made
between autocorrelation, crosscorrelation, andcombination of frequency filtering and crosscorrelationalthough the latter method provided the greatest
improvement, the crosscorrelation technique was the
most successful single methodit turned out that
the maximum improvement obtainable was limited by
the dynamic range of the correlator computer and
not by errors due to finite averaging time and scanning
the delaythe improvement for signals masked by
turbulent noise was found to be aboutdb less than that
obtained for additive noise .response of plates todecaying and convecting randon
following the methods of lyon, an analysis of the
vibratory response ofplate torandom pressure
field is giventhe pressure correlation of the random
field is assumed to havescale small compared to
the plate size, to decay exponentially, and to convect
with constant speed over the platetwo cases are
considered, one in which the convection speed is much
less than the speed of free flexural waves in the plate,
the other in which the convection speed is the same
order as the flexural wave speedthe mean square plate
displacement is shown to be relatively independent
of convection for speeds much less than the flexural
wave speed, and to increase significantly for speeds in
the order of the flexural wave speedit is shown that
damping is usually, but not always, an effective means
of vibration reductionin the case of convection
speeds much smaller than the flexural speed, the use of
hysteretic damping for reduction of the displacement
response is shown to be limited by the decay of the
assumed random pressure field .on turbulent lubricationthe paper concerns the hydrodynamic turbulent
motion in the lubricant layerproceeding
from the reynolds equations and introducing
the approximations currently used in lubrication
problems, owing to the lubricant film
thickness, the general motion equations for
turbulent lubrication are writtenusing the prandtl mixing length hypothesis,
exact and approximate solutions are
obtained for the velocity distribution into the
lubricant layerthe results are discussed by
pointing out the pressure gradient and the
reynolds number influence on the velocity
distributions, as well as the differences with
respect to the laminar flowin order to obtain simple formulae, the
exact dependence of the rate of flow on the
pressure gradient intodimensionless form
is replaced bylinear relation, the slope of
which depends on the reynolds numberthis approximation allows the obtainment of
the pressure differential equation undersimple formthe pressure equation is integrated
in case of journal bearings, by assumingconstant orvariable viscosity of the lubricantthe results are compared to the experimental
data obtained by m. i. smith and d. d.
fuller and the good qualitative agreement is pointed out .the elliptic cylinder inshear flow with hyperbolic
the stream function for the shear flow with hyperbolic
velocity profile past an elliptic cylinder has been determined
as an infinite series of mathieu functionsit is found that
the stagnation streamline of the flow is displaced towardsregion of higher velocity, this displacement increasing
the main stream, (2) as the stream becomes progressively
non-uniform, (3) with increase of minor axis length when
the major axis length remains invariantin each case the displacement
reacheslimiting value as the cylinder moves away
from the axis of symmetry of the streamthese limiting
values are reached at critical distances from the axis of symmetry,
which decrease as the stream becomes progressively non-uniform,
but these distances are approximately independent of incidencethe pressure coefficients and the resultant force and moment
coefficients associated with the cylinder have also been obtained,
and investigated numerically for the flat plate type of cylinder .the motion ofviscous liquid pastparaboloidan approximate solution for the steady
flow of incompressible viscous liquid pastparaboloid of revolution is describedan assumption is made for the form of the
stokes stream function and substituted
into the navier-stokes equations using
paraboloidal coordinatesafter making
suitable approximations,non-linear
differential equation forfunctionis
deducedthe solutions of this equation
depend on the reynolds number of the
flow consideredexamples found by
numerical integration are given to illustrate
the properties of the functionfor
reynolds numbers varying from 0.0001 to
is found, and it is shown that this approximate
solution tends to the perfect fluid
flow away from the boundary, allowance
being made for the displacement effect of
what may be called the boundary layer .the transonic flow ofcompressible fluid through
bymethod similar to that developed by s. tomotika
and k. tamada (quart. appl. math. 7, 381-397 (1950),.
these rev. 11, 275) for computing two-dimensional mixed
isentropic flows in the sonic region, the flow in the vicinity
of the throat of an axially symmetrical nozzle is studiedseveral exact solutions to von karman's equation for axially
symmetrical transonic flows are obtained and the one that
gives flows throughconverging and diverging nozzle is
considered in detailthis solution consists of four branches
of which two are rejected because of singularitiesof the
remaining two branches, one gives pure supersonic flow and
the other gives taylor's type of flow withlocal supersonic
region in the throatby varyingparameter, the latter
branch approaches two asymptotes which yield meyer's
type of asymmetrical flows .conduction of fluctuating heat flow inwall consisting
van gorcum has pointed to interesting and important analogies
between the theory ofpassive four-pole and the conduction of heat
waves through stratiform bodiesthis paper generalizes in certain
regards van gorcum's ideas and draws their consequences for the case ofsolid, bounded by two infinite parallel planes and consisting of any
number of layers made from different materials .measurement of convective heat transfer by means of
preston's method for measuring skin friction in pipes has
been extended to include non-uniform flow, with and without
pressure gradients, over flat surfacesby means ofmodified form of the reynolds analogy, the local convective
heat transfer coefficient can be related to the skin
friction, and it is proposed that the method be used in
aerodynamic models of furnaces and in heat transfer plant
of simple geometrymore investigations are required of
the effects of fluid turbulence, surface roughness and
surface curvature on convective heat transfer and skin
friction .a theory for base pressures in transonic and supersonicphysical flow model is devised based on the concepts of
interaction between the dissipative shear flow and the adjacent
free stream and the conservation of mass in the
wakefour flow components are integrated in the model,.
namely, the flow approaching the trailing edge, the expansion
around the trailing edge, the mixing within the
free-jet boundary, and the recompression at the end of the
wakea unique and stable solution results for the base
pressuretheoretical results obtained for thin approaching
boundary layer do not require empirical information
and are, therefore, best suited to evaluate the merits of the
theoryhere emphasized is the case of isoenergetic constant-pressure
mixing in the turbulent free-jet boundary
and agreement is found between theory and experimental
data .a simplified approximate method for the calculation of the pressure
exact conical-flow solutions are available only for circular cones at
zero angle of attackfor nonaxisymmetric cones or cones at angle of
attack, only approximate methods existthese methods are generally
quite complicated and further limited to certain body shapes or certain
mach-number rangesa great need was therefore felt forsimple
approximate method applicable to any arbitrarily shaped conical body at
zero incidence as well as at angle of attacksuchmethod has been developed recently at lockheed and is presented
here in abbreviated formthe method is based on the /equivalent-cone/
theorythis theory determines the pressure onconical body utilizing
information forsymmetric cone at zero angle of attack with the
same normal component of the free stream with respect to the surface as
the local element of the body consideredthis method works relatively
well at high mach numbershowever, it is quite inconsistent at lower
mach numbers, especially for bodies which deviate considerably from
circular conesthe equivalent-cone method does not give satisfactory
results, mainly due to the fact that it considers only the local surface
element on the body independent of the other body elements in the
newtonian-theory manner .the downstream influence of mass transfer at the nose
the influence of localized mass transfer at the nose ofslender
cone under hypersonic flow conditions has been studied by experimental
and theoretical meanstwo gaseous coolants, nitrogen
and helium, are injected throughporous plug subtendinghalf angle of 30the effect of the mass transfer on the shock
shape, pressure distribution, heat transfer, and transition are investigatedthe experimental work involved tests in the machnumber-8.0
tunnel at pibalthe theoretical analysis involvedstudy of the effect of mass transfer on the shock stand-off
distance and leads to an inviscid-flow parameter permitting the
experimentally determined shock shape and pressure distribution
to be extrapolated to other than test conditions and to other
coolant gasesthere is obtained the maximum value of this
parameter resulting in no significant alteration of the pressure
distribution on the cone and thus defining the flows in which
boundary-layer-type similarity appliessignificant reductions in heat transfer are obtained with injectionindeed, with small amounts of helium injection the
peak heating is found to occur downstream on the cone and to be
an order of magnitude less than would occur at the stagnation
point without mass transferwith nitrogen early transition is
found to occur, so that local heating rates are actually increased
over those prevailing at the same reynolds number without injection
.a summary of the supersonic pressure drag of bodiesnumber of approximate theories for supersonic and hypersonic
flow over bodies of revolution at zero angle of attack are
appraised bycritical comparison with characteristics and
second-order results, with the use of hypersonic similarity asbasis for the comparisonmost of the approximate theories
are inadequate except over very limited ranges of fineness ratio
and mach numberthe combination of second-order supersonic
theory and second-order shock-expansion theory provides
consistently good results throughout the supersonic speed rangeon the basis of exact (or nearly exact) supersonic solutions andlimited amount of test data and theory in the transonic region,
summary design curves are developed that give the pressure
drag of conical and ogive noses and conical and ogive boattails
over the complete range of transonic, supersonic, and hypersonic
mach numbersother shapes can be analyzed in the same manner,
provided that an equivalent amount of data is availablethe analysis is made with the assumption of inviscid flow,
so that the effects of boundary-layer growth, shock-boundarylayer
interaction, and flow separation are not includedthe present
correlations providesound basis of inviscid-flow results
from which these additional viscous effects can be evaluated .measurements of skin friction of the compressible turbulent
measurements of average skin friction of the turbulent boundary
layer have been made on15 total included angle cone with
foreign gas injectionmeasurements of total skin-friction drag
were obtained at free-stream mach numbers of 0.3, 0.7, 3.5, and10 with injection of helium, air, and freon-12
through the porous wallsubstantial reductions in skin friction
are realized with gas injection within the range of mach
numbers of this testthe relative reduction in skin friction is
in accordance with theory--that is, the light gases are most
effective when compared onmass flow basisthere ismarked
effect of mach number on the reduction of average skin friction,.
this effect is not shown by the available theorieslimited transition
location measurements indicate that the boundary layer
does not fully trip with gas injection but that the transition point
approachesforward limit with increasing injectionthe variation
of the skin-friction coefficient, for the lower injection rates
with natural transition, is dependent on the flow reynolds number
and type of injected gas,. and at the high injection rates the
skin friction is in fair agreement with the turbulent boundarylayer
results .an investigation of two-dimensional supersonic base
an investigation of the base pressure behind wedges at mach
numbersandin the laminar and the transitional regime is
reportedtemperature and velocity traverses through the
mixing zone are shown and exploratory investigations of the
wake vortex by use of hot wires and flow-visualization techniques
are describedit is found that the laminar two-dimensional base
pressure agrees well with chapman's theoretical predictionsthe shear layer exhibits gross velocity distributions characteristic
of the free jet mixing zone, but also shows disturbances that
originate in the expansion-turning of the oncoming boundary
layeran interesting trailing vortex is observed, which is
explained in terms of nonuniform mixing rate in the wake .supersonic axially symmetric nozzlesat each of twenty-one exit mach numbers, ranging
from 1.008 to 8.238, ten supersonic axially symmetric
nozzle shapes with plane sonic surfaces have been computed
on the eniac by the method of characteristicsthe
boundary of the shortest of each group of ten hassharp edge at the sonic plane, while the others have
smooth boundariesthis report describes the computational
procedures and presentssample of the results for twenty
nozzlesmore extensive and elaborate tables of the results of the
entire computations are available at the ballistic
research laboratoriesnozzle contours can be obtained
accurately from them by interpolation for exit mach numbers
between 1.479 and 8.238 forwide range of ratios of nozzle
length to throat diameter .effects of free stream vorticity on the behaviour of
theoretical investigation is considered of the two-dimensional
steady flow field at large distance fromfinite object set inviscous incompressible fluidstudy is made of coordinate-type
expansions for pressure and velocity for large r, uniformly in, for
fixed reynolds number, assuming exact boundary conditions at infinity
and regularity of flow with zero net mass flow acrosssimple curve enclosing the objectmathematical nature of the distinction between parameter and
coordinate-type expansions is discussed with description of inner
and outer expansions and matching techniquesa feature of the expansion procedure is the introduction of an
artificial parameterinner and outer expansions are matched with
the aid of known solutions of the navier-stokes equationsanalysis
requires simple consideration of the heat and laplace equations
without resort to special methodspaper is worth studying by those interested in asymptotic expansion
procedures .an investigation of the noise produced bysubsonic air jetto investigate the theoretical predictions of lighthill on aerodynamic
sound, measurements have been made of the sound field of1 in. air jet
issuing fromlong pipethe measurements have been made overwide
frequency band (30 to 10,000 cycles/sec.) and in one-third octave bands
in this frequency rangethe mean mach number at the pipe orifice was
varied from 0.3 to 1.0the dependence of the apparent position of the noise sources on frequency
and jet speed was investigatedatgiven frequencysource is
situated farther from the jet orifice the higher the jet speedlower
frequency sources appear farther downstream than ones of higher frequency,
consistent with their association with larger eddiesthe
directional characteristics of the sound field at different frequencies
and jet speeds are illustrated by means of scale diagrams showing lines
of constant sound intensitythese sound fields are analyzed in terms
of the moving quadrupole sources of lighthill's theory and good agreement
obtainedit is shown that the apparent spread of the sources at
low frequencies is due to the doppler effectat low frequency (relative
to the frequency of maximum power output) the radiation is predominantly
that of three mutually orthogonal longitudinal quadrupoles
which, except for the effect of convection upon it, hassound field
likemonopole sourceat higher frequencies the sound fields of
lateral and longitudinal quadrupoles predominate .the behaviour of non-linear systemsmany of the phenomena that occur in the world around us are
governed by nonlinear relationshipsin the development of the
mathematical sciences, the difficulties of nonlinear analysis have
hindered the formulation of nonlinear concepts that would permit
us to understand such phenomenain the present article,
our progress in understanding the behavior of nonlinear systems
is reviewed and an attempt is made to present the resulting concepts
in suchway that they may be applied with some generality
to other problems .two-dimensional jet mixing ofcompressible fluidthe mixing and divergence ofsupersonic jet exhausting intosupersonic stream are investigated theoreticallyin the first part of this paper, the flow is assumed to be laminarwhen the velocity and temperature in the jet are different
slightly from those of the surrounding stream, by the method of
small perturbations and under ordinary boundary layer assumptions,
the equation of motion of two-dimensional flow will be
reduced toform of the well-known equation of heat conduction,
whose solution is known for any given boundary conditionsit
has also been shown that the exact solution of the two-dimensional
jet mixing of viscous compressible fluids can be obtained
by successive approximations starting with the solution of small
perturbationsvelocity and temperature distributions for two cases--one is
the mixing of two-uniform flows and the other is the mixing ofjet of compressible fluid fromtwo-dimensional nozzle with full
expansion exhausting intosupersonic stream--have been calculatedthe properties of the jet mixing depend mainly on the
momentum of the jet regardless of whether the change of momentum
is due to the change of velocity or the change of temperature--i.e.,
the change of densitycompressibility hasconsiderable
effect on the properties of the jetin the second part, the cases of turbulent flow are investigatedby means of reichardt's theory of free turbulence, the turbulent
shearing stress may be expressed asit has been shown in this paper that
where isconstant that can be determined experimentallythe value oflies betweenand.  the exact value ofdepends
on the condition of mixingwhen the expression of turbulent shearing stress given above
is used instead of the viscous stress in the equation of motion,
by suitable transformation of variables, it has been shown that
the equation of two-dimensional turbulent jet mixing is identical
to that of the laminar casehence, the solution of the first part
of this paper can be applied to the turbulent case, provided that
the characteristic constants andhave been properly chosen .viscosity effects in sound waves of finite amplitude:
this article has as its subject /the conflicting influence on
sound propagation of convection on the one hand, and of diffusion
and relaxation on the other/, whose importance in the determination
of the structure of shock waves was first appreciated clearly
by sir geoffrey tayloras an essential introduction to the main
topics, author gives an exceptionally clear and valuable account
of the physical mechanisms of viscosity, thermal conductivity, and
other diffusion effects, including relaxationthe classical theory
of shock-wave formation is then discussed, and some extensions
are madethe remainder of the article is based on the demonstration that
the nonlinear equation for plane progressive sound waves, in which
convection and diffusion are taken into account tofirst approximation,
can be transformed into burgers's equation, the general
solution of which was given by hopf and colethis approach, in
which all flows are continuous (they become discontinuous at
shock waves in the limit as viscosity, etc., tend to zero), allows
the author to re-derive and extend whitham's theory of the formation
and decay of weak plane shock waves, and to derive many
new results, such as the velocity distributions during the union
of two shock waves and during the formation ofshock wavethe application of the same idea to non-plane shock waves is
also discussed, but more briefly,. in these cases, burgers's equation
is not quite suchgood approximation as beforethe article concludes with sections on sound waves whose
reynolds numbers based on the length scale of the flow and the
velocity amplitude are comparable with unity, and on the effects
of relaxation on the properties of shock wavesthe whole is
much more thansurvey, and representsvery substantial advance
in the theory of sound wavesit is the finest possible
tribute to sir geoffrey taylor that he should be able to inspire
articles such as this and the others in this volume .some effects of surface curvature on laminar boundary
the laminar flow ofviscous incompressible fluid overtwodimensional
curved surface is investigated for two cases, one in
which the curvature is /large/ and the other in which it is
cases are obtained as approximations from the exact equations of
motion by an order-of-magnitude analysisthese equations are
solved for flow overparticular surface with zero surface pressure
gradientin this analysis, the pressure gradient normal to the
surface is included, and the outer boundary conditions are modified
in accordance with the requirements of flow overcurved
surfacethe results indicate that for equal reynolds numbers, the
stress on convex surfaces is less than the flat-plate value, while
the stress on concave surfaces is greater than forflat platethe
most important effect of surface curvature, for the cases considered,
is the modification of the shape of the velocity profile
near the /outer edge/ of the boundary layerthe requirement
thatsmooth transition exist between the viscous flow and the
potential flow at the outer edge of the layer causes the profile to
havenegative slope near the outer edge for convex surface
curvature andpositive slope for concave surface curvature .note on an interaction between the boundary layer and the inviscid
according to the classical boundary-layer theory the flow about bodies
at reynolds numbers of aeronautical interest can be considered as composed
of two regimes..  an outside inviscid flow andthin boundarylayer
region adjacent to the bodythis point of view leads to the
approximation that, onslightly curved surface, throughout the layer
is negligibly smallthe additional assumption that the inviscid flow
is irrotational leads to the requirement that is zero at the outer edge
of the boundary layerin this theory any interaction between the two
regimes is accountable bysimple correction to the body shape based on
the boundary-layer displacement thicknessrecently, in connection with hypersonic laminar boundary layers, this
classical point of view has been modified., an interaction between the
two flow regimes leading toself-induced axial pressure gradient has
been consideredit is the purpose of the present note to point out
another type of interaction which may be of practical importance and of
fundamental interest even at mach numbers below those considered in the
hypersonic boundary-layer theory and which may have to be considered in
that theory .the calculation of wall shearing stress from heat-transfer measurements
it has been shown by ludwieg that the wall shearing stress oflaminar
or turbulent boundary layer in an incompressible flow can be determined
fromheat-transfer measurement at the surfacethe instrument
used in that investigation was essentiallysmall, locally insulated,
heating element embedded in the test surfacethe size of the instrument
was restricted by the condition that the thermal boundary layer
generated by the heating element be contained locally within the laminar
sublayerin the present analysis ludweig's theory for such an instrument
is extended to compressible flow over an insulated flat platewith the same limitations on the design and operation of the instrument
as mentioned above, it can also be assumed for compressible laminar
and turbulent boundary layers that only the flow in the immediate vicinity
of the wall or the laminar sublayer will be affected in the region
of the heated elementthis assumption then permits the use of the
laminar boundary-layer equations as the governing equations for this
analysis for both laminar and turbulent boundary layers .recent developments in rocket nozzle configurationsexisting configurations of supersonic portion of rocket nozzles
are described and comparedsurvey covers bell-type conical and
contoured nozzles, annular nozzles, plug nozzles, and the author's
own /e-d/ (expansion-deflection) nozzlethe latter isbelltype
nozzle in which the gases are first deflected radially outward
bysmall central plug, then expanded radially inward around the
base of the plug, and finally deflected back tonearly axial direction
by the nozzle wall, in compressive turning .the generation of sound by aerodynamic meansa summary is given of some of the more important experimental results
relating to the noise radiated fromcold subsonic turbulent jetthese are then related to the predictions of lighthill's general theory
of aerodynamic noise .wakes in axial compressorsthe tendency in the past has been to assume that
when wakes or non-uniform total head profiles are
fed into an axial compressor then substantially constant
static pressure prevails at the entry, the variations in total
head appearing as variations in velocitythis variation
in velocity causes variation in incidence on the early stage
blade rows and thus can give rise to excitation of blade
vibrationthis assumption is implicit, for instance, in
referencesand 2, but we think has beencommon assumption
by most of the people working in this fieldwhere the compressor is fed byduct of substantially
parallel walls forreasonable length ahead, such an assumption
appeared justifiablesuchduct when given
an air flow test with its outlet discharging, for instance,
to atmosphere instead of to the compressor, then the distribution
assumed would normally be obtained and in fact
many surveys of such ducts have been represented in this
fashionthe object of this note is to show that, in fact,
this distribution will not normally occur when the compressor
is present and we may normally expect much more
nearlyconstant velocity into the compressor with attendant
static pressure distributions to match with the total
head variations ahead of the intake, with of course, the
attendant curved flow to support the static pressure
gradients .viscous effects on pitot tubes at low speedsmeasurements were made of the pressure inblunt-nosed pitot
tube, in an air stream at reynolds numbers from about 15 to 1000the results are expressed in terms ofpressure coefficient
density of the fluid, andandare the static pressure and velocity
in the undisturbed streamas found in previous investigations,
becomes greater thanat low reynolds numbers, the
increase being about atreynolds number of 50 (based
on external tube radius)in disagreement with the work of hurd,
chesky, and shapiro, no decrease of belowwas found at any
reynolds numberwhen the values of found by various experiments are
plotted against reynolds numbers based on internal tube radius,
it is found that the curves are in closer agreement than when the
external radius is used .the determination of turbulent skin friction by meanssimple method of determining
local turbulent skin friction onsmooth
surface has been developed which utilisesround pitot tube resting on the surfaceassuming the existence ofregion near the
surface in which conditions are functions
only of the skin friction, the relevant physical
constants of the fluid andsuitable length,universal non-dimensional relation is
obtained for the difference between the total
pressure recorded by the tube and the static
pressure at the wall, in terms of the skin
frictionthis relation, on this assumption,
is independent of the pressure gradientthe truth and form of the relation were first
established, toconsiderable degree of
accuracy, inpipe using four geometrically
similar round pitot tubes--the diameter
being taken as representative lengththese four
pitot tubes were then used to determine
the local skin friction coefficient at three stations
onwind tunnel wall, under varying
conditions of pressure gradientat each station,
within the limits of experimental
accuracy, the deduced skin friction coefficient was
found to be the same for each pitot
tube, thus confirming the basic assumption and
leaving little doubt as to the correctness
of the skin friction so foundpitot traverses
were then made in the pipe and in the
boundary layer on the wind tunnel wallthe results
were plotted in two non-dimensional
forms on the basis already suggested and they
fell close together inregion whose
outer limit represented the breakdown of the
basic assumption, but close to the wall
the results spread out, due to the unknown
displacement of the effective centre ofpitot tube nearwallthis again provides
further evidence of the existence ofregion of local dynamical similarity and of the
correctness of the skin friction deduced
from measurements with round pitot tubes on
the wind tunnel wallthe extent of the
region in which the local dynamical similarity
may be expected to hold appears to vary
from about to of the boundary-layer
thickness for conditions remote from,
and close to, separation respectively .free-flight techniques for high speed aerodynamic researchthe development rocket-borne and rocket-launched high-speed airplane
model test is describeddetails of airborne components, telemetering
units, tracking, and their calibration are also discussedtests on controls, drag measurements, longitudinal stability evaluations,
lift measurements, pressure measurements, aeroelastic estimations,
and sonic bang recordings are effectedthe reynolds numbers
involved are much higher than are usual in the wind tunnel, and extensions
of mach numbers are obtained beyond the tunnel limits, both free
of the tunnel wall interference .the problem of aerodynamic heatingpaper isgood review of knowledge to date on convective heat
transfer to objects moving through air at low and high speedstheoretical and experimental information is given on recovery factors
and heat-transfer coefficients for isothermal surfaces of unswept
flat plates, wedges and cones with attached shock waves,
and stagnation points of blunt bodies of revolution, for both laminar
and turbulent boundary layersa convenient nomograph for
calculating flat plate turbulent boundary-layer heat-transfer coefficients
is giveneffects of surface cooling, surface roughness,
and supply stream turbulence on transition are discussed and
shown graphically .interplanetary orbitsthe basic equations under simplified
conditions for interplanetary flight are derivedforvoyage from planet to planet an
unlimited number of orbits is possiblein
order to giveclear survey of these possible
orbitsdiagram is developed from which the
approximate energy-requirement, the duration,
and other particulars ofvoyage can be
easily found .heat flow in composite slabsthis paper presents the solution of the heat flow problem
in composite walls under heat transfer conditions
which are typical of uncooled rocket engine wallsanalytic
expressions in the form of fourier sums are obtained
for the temperature distribution incomposite wall consisting
of an inner (refractory) medium and an outer (metallic)
medium under newtonian heat transfer into the
first medium with negligible heat transfer from the
second medium to the exteriorthe expressions obtained
are based onplane parallel composite slab asrepresentative
model for relatively thin cylindrical walls, with
thickness-to-radius ratio not exceeding 0.2the general
results for the composite slab are simplified for the limiting
cases ofthin refractory shield withthick shielded medium
andthick refractory shield withthin shielded
medium .skin friction in the laminar boundary layer in compressible
from an analysis of the work of
crocco and others, semi-empirical formulae
are derived for the skin friction onflat plate at zero incidence withlaminar
boundary layerthese formulae are
for the general case of heat transfer, and
when there is no heat transferthe problem of heat transfer and
the effect of radiation are discussed in the
light of these formulaethe second
formula is then utilised in the development of
an approximate method for solving the
momentum equation of the boundary layer
oncylinder without heat transferthe method indicates that with increase of
mach number there ismarked forward
movement of separation fromflat plate
in the presence ofconstant adverse velocity gradient .supersonic flow past slender bodies with discontinuous
ward's slender-body theory is extended to derive first approximations
to the external forces on slender
bodies of general cross section
with discontinuous profile slopetwo
classes of body are considered ..
bodies whose profile (typified by the local
radius) is continuous between the
nose and base, and certain bodies whose
profile is discontinuous, such as
bodies with annular or side air intakes and
wing-bodies on which the wing
has an unswept leading edge(where air
intakes are concerned, it is
assumed that they are sharp-edged and that
there is no /spillage/ of the
internal flow)the following conclusions apply to
the former class of bodiesthe
variation of drag with mach number is
found to depend only on the discontinuities
in the longitudinal rate of change
of the cross-sectional area, and is
thus independent of cross-sectional shapethe drag itself is unchanged if
the direction of the flow is reversedthe
expressions for lift and moment
assume the same forms as for smooth pointed
bodies, the lift depending only
on conditions at the base of the bodythe general theory is applied to
winged bodies of revolution with an
unswept wing leading edge ..  the results
bearmarked resemblance to those
obtained by wardthe results for wings
alone are seen to be applicable,
with one modification, to subsonic as well as to supersonic speeds .supersonic flow past slender pointed wings with ?similar?
some recent theoretical work on slender pointed wings at zero lift is
co-ordinated and extendedthe wings
considered may have any pointed plan
form shape, provided that the trailing
edge is straight and unsweptthe root
section profile and cross-section shapes
are arbitrary, provided that, on any
one wing, the latter are /descriptively
similar/ (diamond or parabolic biconvex
for instance), though not necessarily
geometrically similarthe chief aim of
the work is to find wings with simple
geometry, low wave drag and pressure
distributions which are unlikely to be
seriously affected by viscous effectswave drag and pressure distributions
are calculated by slender-wing theorygeneral formulae, which are both simple
and instructive, are given for the wave
drag and the overall pressure distribution,
with particular emphasis on the root
pressure distributionresults fornumber
of wings of special interest are
presented and discussed .on displacement thicknessfour alternative theoretical treatments of 'displacement
thickness', and, generally, of the influence of boundary layers
and wakes on the flow outside them, are set out, first for twodimensional,
and then for three-dimensional, laminar or turbulent,
incompressible flowthey may be called the methods of 'flow
reduction', 'equivalent sources', 'velocity comparison' andthe principal expression obtained for the displacement
thickness in three-dimensional flow may be written
if, as orthogonal coordinates (x,y) specifying position on the
surface, we chooseas the velocity potential of the external
flow, andascoordinate, constant along the external-flow
streamlines, such thatdy is the distance between (x,y) andis the distance from the surface,andare theandcomponents
of velocity, andtakes the valuejust outside the boundary layer .expansions at small reynolds number for the flow past
this paper is concerned with the problem of obtaining higher
approximations to the flow pastsphere andcircular cylinder
than those represented by the well-known solutions of stokes
and oseensince the perturbation theory arising from the
consideration of small non-zero reynolds numbers issingular
one, the problem is largely that of devising suitable techniques for
taking this singularity into account when expanding the solution
for small reynolds numbersthe technique adopted is as followsseparate, locally valid
the regions close to, and far from, the obstaclereasons are
presented for believing that these 'stokes' and 'oseen' expansions
are, respectively, of the forms
where are spherical or cylindrical polar coordinates made
dimensionless with the radius of the obstacle,is the reynolds
number, and and vanish with.  substitution
of these expansions in the navier-stokes equation then yieldsset of differential equations for the coefficients and, but
only one set of physical boundary conditions is applicable to each
expansion (the no-slip conditions for the stokes expansion, and
the uniform-stream condition for the oseen expansion) so that
unique solutions cannot be derived immediatelyhowever, the
fact that the two expansions are (in principle) both derived from
the same exact solution leads to'matching' procedure which
yields further boundary conditions for each expansionit is thus
possible to determine alternately successive terms in each
expansionthe leading terms of the expansions are shown to be closely
related to the original solutions of stokes and oseen, and detailed
results for some further terms are obtained .integration of the boundary layer equationsthe equations of the boundary layer
are integrated by an expression of the form
where f(x) ispositive function with x=0
as the stationary point,. (x) is slowly varying,.
the integral contains an unknown parameter
which is found from the conditionthe integral is evaluated by the method of
steepest descentthe expressions obtained are
usually divergent, except in few cases which
include blasius's equation,. the divergent
expressions are summed by euler's transformationto check the procedure it is applied to falkner
and skan's equationthe results obtained
are very striking,. few terms in the expansions
are sufficient to obtain close agreement with
hartree's laborious numerical computationsthe method is also applied to the general
boundary-layer equation for the case of flow past
an elliptic cylinder, measured by schubauerthe results obtained are in close agreement
with schubauer's measurements for the velocities,
almost up to separation, for the position of
the separation point,. and in satisfactory agreement downstream of
separation .the generation of noise by isotropic turbulencea finite region, with fixed boundaries, of an
infinite expanse of compressible fluid is in
turbulent motionthis motion generates noise
and radiates it into the surrounding fluidthe acoustic properties of the system are studied
in the special case in which the turbulent
region consists of decaying isotropic turbulenceit is assumed that the reynolds number
of the turbulence is large, and that the mach number is smallthe noise appears to be generated mainly
by those eddies of the turbulence whose
contribution to the rate of dissipation of kinetic
energy by viscosity is negligibleit is shown that the intensity of sound at large
distances from the turbulence is the same
as that due tovolume distribution of simple acoustic
sources occupying the turbulent regionin this analogy, the whole fluid is to be regarded
asstationary and uniform acoustic
mediumthe local value of the acoustic power outputper mass of turbulent fluid is given
approximately by the formula
whereisnumerical constant,is the
mean-square velocity fluctuation, is the time, andis the velocity of sound in the fluidthe
constantis expressed in terms of the well-known
velocity correlation function f(r) by
assuming the joint probability distribution of the
turbulent velocities and their first two
time-derivatives at two points in space to be
gaussianthe numerical value is
then obtained by substituting the form of f(r)
corresponding to heisenberg's theoretical
spectrum of isotropic turbulenceit is found that the effects of decay make
onlysmall contribution to the value of a, and
that the order of magnitude ofis not changed
when widely differing forms of the function
f(r) are used .on the flow of compressible fluid past an obstacleit is well known that according to classical hydrodynamicssteady
stream of frictionless incompressible fluid exercises no resultant
force upon an obstacle, such asrigid sphere, immersed in itthe
development of/resistance/ is usually attributed to viscosity, or
when there issharp edge to the negative pressure which may accompany
it (helmholtz)in either case it would seem that resistance involves
something of the nature ofwake, extending behind the obstacle to an
infinite distancewhen the system of disturbed velocities, although
it may mathematically extend to infinity, remains as it were attached to
the obstacle, there can be no resistancethe absence of resistance is asserted for an incompressible fluid., but
it can hardly be supposed thatsmall degree of compressibility, as in
water, would affect the conclusionon the other hand, high relative
velocities, exceeding that of sound in the fluid, must entirely alter
the conditionsit seems worth while to examine this question more
closely, especially as the first effects of compressibility are amenable
to mathematical treatment .on the steady motion of viscous, incompressible fluids,
except in exceptional cases, it is not possible to represent the
motion ofviscous incompressible liquid by means ofvariation
principle, but all cases of such motion that have yet been discovered
belong to this class of /exceptional cases ./  the appropriate functions
are given .velocity and temperature distributions in the turbulent
recently (see abstract 954 (1938)) goldstein made calculations based
on theories of vorticity transfer, of the distributions of velocity and
temperature in the turbulent wake behindheated body of revolution,
and the present authors now record an experimental determination of
these distributions inlow-turbulence wind tunneldifficulty was
experienced in obtainingtruly symmetrical wake and observations
have been reduced to mean values, curves of which are given .on the solution of the laminar boundary layer equationsthe problem of the flow alongflat plate

accuracy, and the eighth and ninth
roughlyunfortunately it appears
that about eight more terms are
required to carry the solution to
the point of separation,. the work
involved in their determination is

have been developed for determining
the error when the first seven terms
of the series are used as an approximationthese methods lead to the
determination of the point of separation

whena method is
developed for the solution of the
boundary layer equations in any retarded regionit is obtained by replacing
the velocity distribution at the edge
of the boundary layer bycircumscribing
polygon of infinitesimal sides and
applying the preceding solution

differential equation .the effect of shallow water on wave resistancethe general character of experimental
results dealing with the effect of
shallow water on ship resistance may be
stated briefly as follows ..--at low
velocities the resistance in shallow
water is greater than in deep water, the
speed at which the excess is first
appreciable varying with the type of vesselas the speed increases, the excess
resistance increases up tomaximum atcertain critical velocity, and then
diminisheswith still further increase of
speed, the resistance in shallow
water ultimately becomes, and remains, less
than that in deep water at the same speedthe maximum effect is the more
pronounced the shallower the waterfor further details and references one
may refer to standard treatises, but one
quotation may be made in regard to
the critical velocity ..  /this maximum
appears to be at aboutspeed such
thattrochoidal wave travelling at this
speed in water of the same depth is
about times as long as the vesselit was at one time supposed
that the speed for maximum increase
in resistance was that of the wave of
translationthis, however, holds only
for water whose depth is less than
for greater depths the speed of the
wave of translation rapidly becomes
greater than the speed of maximum
increase of resistance ./  inrecent
analysis of the data, h. m. weitbrecht
expressessimilar conclusion by stating
that for each depth of water there iscritical velocity, but that the critical
velocity does not vary as the square
root of the corresponding depth .the hodographic transformation in transonic flowthe author studies the problem of finding the shape ofsymmetrical nozzle with the velocity along the axis (x-axis)

increase steadilythe singularity at the sonic velocity and
to the axis of the nozzle) is first studied in the physical

charts are presented for determining complete temperature
historics in spheres, cylinders, and platesit
is shown that for values of the dimensionless time ratiogreater than 0.2 the heating equations reduce to suchsimple form that for each shape two charts which give
temperatures at any position within the heated or cooled
bodies can be plottedit is also shown that the usual
simple heating and cooling charts can also be used for the
determination of temperatures and heating times in
bodies heated byconstant rate of heat generation at
the surface (induction heating)finally,two-dimensional
chart is given for finding heating times in short
cylinders, thereby eliminating the trial-and-error solution
that is necessary when heating times are found from
the present one-dimensional charts .numerical methods for transient heat flowthis paper deals with the application of numerical
methods for the solution of heat-conduction problems,

.approximate analytical solutions for hypersonic flow
approximate analytical solutions are presented
for two-dimensional and axisymmetric
hypersonic flow over blunt-nosed slender bodies whose
shapes followpower law variationin particular,
the body shape is given by where is the
transverse body ordinate, is the streamwise distance
from the nose, andisconstant in the rangeboth zero-order solutions
and first-order (small but nonvanishing values
of solutions are presented, whereis the
free-stream mach number and ischaracteristic

is similar to the body shape for these flowsthe
solutions are found within the framework of
hypersonic-slender-body theorythe limiting case m=1 corresponds towedge
or cone flowthe limiting case
corresponds toconstant-energy flowthe latter cases are included
so that the present study may be applied to all flows
wherein the zero-order shock shape is given by
within the rangeflow
fields associated with shock shapes having values ofoutside this range are also discussedfor all values
of, except m=1, certain portions of the flow field
riolate the hypersonic-slender-body approximations,
while other portions are consistent with these approximationsfor m=1, all portions of the flow field
are consistent with the approximationsthe approximate solutions are found as followsthe asymptotic form of the flow in the vicinity of the
body surface is used asguide to write approximate
expressions for the dependent variablesthese
expressions exactly satisfy the continuity and
energy equations and contain arbitrary constants
which are evaluated so as to satisfy boundary conditions
at the shockthe approximate solutions do
not satisfy the lateral momentum equation except at
the shock and (for the first-order problem) at the body

compared with numerical integrations of the equations
of motion for various values ofand (ratio
of specific heats)good agreement is noted, particularly
whenand are both near onethe
shock is relatively close to the body for the latter

results are summarized with emphasis on the sphere
and paraboloid .nearly circular transfer trajectories for descending
simplified expressions describing the transfer
fromsatellite orbit to the point of atmospheric
entry are derivedthe expressions are limited to
altitude changes that are small compared with the
earth's radius, and velocity changes small compared
with satellite velocitythey are further restricted
to motion aboutspherical, nonrotating earththe transfer orbit resulting from the application
of thrust in any direction at any point in an elliptic
orbit is consideredexpressions for the errors in
distance (miss distance) and entry angle due to an
initial misalinement and magnitude error of the deflecting
thrust are presentedthe largest potential contributing factor towardsmiss distance stems from the misalinement of the
retrovelocity incrementif this velocity increment is
pointed in direct opposition to the flight path,1
misalinement leads tomiss distance of 34.5 mileshowever, it is shown that this error can be avoided
by applying the velocity increment at an angle between
120 and 150 below the flight-path directionthe guidance and accuracy requirements to establishcircular orbit, in addition to the corrections
applied to transform elliptic orbits into circular
ones, are also discussed .an analysis of the corridor and guidance requirements
an analysis is presented of supercircular entry
intoplanet's atmosphere giving particular attention
to the corridor through which spacecraft must be
guided in order to accomplish various maneuversa dimensionless parameter based on conditions at
the conic perigee altitude is introduced for characterizing
supercircular entries and conveniently prescribing
corridor widths associated with elliptic,
parabolic, or hyperbolic approach trajectoriesthe
analysis applies to vehicles of arbitrary weight, shape,
and sizeillustrative calculations are made for
venus, earth, mars, jupiter, and titanfor nonlifting vehicles having fixed aerodynamic
coefficients, curves are presented of dimensionless
parameters from which can be calculated the maximum
deceleration, maximum rate of laminar convective
heating, and total laminar heat absorbed during
single-pass entry at velocities up to twice circular
velocityfor lifting vehicles, curves are presented of
the maximum deceleration and overshoot boundary
of an entry corridor,. equations are presented for
estimating laminar aerodynamic heating from the
maximum decelerationit is shown that the corridor
width is independent of vehicle weight, dimensions,
and drag coefficient, provided these are the same at
the overshoot boundary as at undershootthe
corridors of certain planets can be broadened markedly
by the application of aerodynamic lift,. for
example, the 10-earth-g corridor width for singlepass,
nonlifting, parabolic entry is increased from
to 52, 51, and 52 miles, respectively, by employinglift-drag ratio of.  the use of aerodynamic lift
does not increase appreciably the corridors of mars
and titanall corridor widths decrease rapidly
as the entry velocity is increasedterminal guidance requirements on accuracy of
velocity and flight path angle for successfully entering
various corridors are compared with analogous
requirements for puttingsatellite into orbit, for
hitting the moon from the earth, and for achieving
icbm accuracyconsideration is given to the
terminal guidance problem involved in usingplanet's atmosphere--rather than rocket fuel--to
effect orbital transfers from heliocentric to planetocentric
motion, thereby convertinghyperbolic
approach trajectory to an elliptic orbit about the
target planetthis fuel saving maneuver appears
technologically feasible for certain planetary voyages,
and implies the possibility of achievinglarge
reduction in required earth lift-off weight of chemical
propulsion systems .an approximate analytical method for studying entry
the pair of motion equations for entry intoplanetary atmosphere is reduced tosingle, ordinary,
nonlinear differential equation of second order by
disregarding two relatively small terms and by introduringcertain mathematical transformationthe
reduced equation includes various terms, certain of
which represent the gravity force, the centrifugal
acceleration, and the lift forceif these particular
terms are disregarded, the differential equation is
linear and yields precisely the solution of allen and
eggers applicable to ballistic entry at relatively steep
angles of descentif all the other terms in the basic
equation are disregarded (corresponding to negligible
vertical acceleration and negligible vertical component
of drag force), the resulting truncated differential
equation yields the solution of sanger for equilibrium
flight of glide vehicles with relatively large lift-drag
ratiosa number of solutions for lifting and nonlifting
vehicles entering at various initial angles also have
been obtained from the complete nonlinear equationthese solutions are universal in the sense thatsingle solution determines the motion and heating
ofvehicle of arbitrary weight, dimensions, and
shape entering an arbitrary planetary atmosphereone solution is required for each lift-drag ratiothese solutions are used to study the deceleration,
heating rate, and total heat absorbed for entry into
venus, earth, mars, and jupiterfrom the
equations developed for heating rates, and from
available information on human tolerance limits
to acceleration stress, approximate conditions for
minimizing the aerodynamic heating oftrimmed
vehicle with constant lift-drag ratio are established
for several types of manned entrya brief study
is included of the process of atmosphere braking for
slowingvehicle from near escape velocity to near
satellite velocity .skin-friction measurements in incompressible flow.
experiments have been conducted to measure in
incompressible flow the local surface-shear stress
and the average skin-friction coefficient forturbulent
boundary-layer onsmooth flat plate having zero pressure gradientthe local surface-shear stress was measured byfloating-element skinfriction
balance and also bycalibrated total head
tube located on the surface of the test wallthe
average skin-friction coefficient was obtained from
boundary-layer velocity profilesthe boundary-layer
profiles were also used to determine the location
of the virtual origin of the turbulent boundary layerdata were obtainec forrange of reynolds numbers
frommillion to about 45 million with an attendant
change in mach number from 0.11 to 0.32the measured local skin-friction coefficients obtained
with the floating-element balance agree
well with those of schultz-grunow and kempf
for reynolds numbers up to 45 millionthe
measured average skin-friction coefficients agree
with those given by the schoenherr curve in the
ranges of reynolds numbers fromtomillion
and 30 to 45 millionin the range of reynolds
numbers fromto 30 million the measured values
are less than those predicted by the schoenherrcurvethe results show that the /univeral skin-friction constants/
proposed by coles appraoch asymptoticallyconstant value at reynolds numbers exceeding
mentioned constants and the limited reynolds
number range of the present investigation, there is some doubt
as to the validity of any turbulent
skin-friction law written on the basis of the present
resultshence, no new friction law is proposedthe frictional resistance offlat plate was
calculated by means of the momentum method and
also the integrated measured local surface shearfor reynolds numbers from 14 million to 45 million
both methods give about the same result,. whereas
at lower values of reynolds number the momentum
method based on velocity profiles uncorrected for
the effects of turbulence results infrictional
resistance as much aspercent higher than that
of the integrated shearthe measurement of local surface shear bycalibrated preston tube appears to be accurate
and inexpensivethe calibration as given by
preston must be modified slighlty, however, to yield the
results obtained from the floating-element skin-friction
balance .flow of chemically reacting gas mixturessuitable forms of the equations
for the flow of an inviscid, nonheat-conducting
gas in which chemical
reactions are occurring are derivedthe effects of mass diffusion and nonequilibrium
amongst the internal
modes of the molecules are neglectedspecial attention is given to
the speeds of sound in suchgas
mixture andgeneral expression for
the ratio of frozen to equilibrium
sound speeds is deducedan example
is given for the ideal dissociating
gasthe significance of the velocity
defined by the ratio of the convective
derivatives of pressure and density is
explainedit is the velocity
which exists at the throat ofconvergentdivergent
duct under maximum
mass flow conditions, and it is shown that
this velocity depends on the
nozzle geometry as well as on the 'reservoir' conditionsas an illustration the phenomena of
sound absorption and dispersion are
discussed for the ideal dissociating gasthe results can be concisely
expressed in terms of the frozen and
equilibrium sound speeds, the
frequency of the (harmonic) sound
vibration andcharacteristic time for
the rate of progress of the reaction .linearized flow ofdissociating gasthe equations for planar two-dimensional

equilibriumas an example of their solution, the
flow pastsharp corner insupersonic
stream is evaluated and the variations
of flow properties in the relaxation zone
are foundnumerical illustrations are
provided using an 'oxygen-like' ideal gas
and comparisons made withcharacteristics
solutionthe flow pastsharp
corner can be studied inconventional
shock tube and it may be possible to
verify the present theory experimentallyin particular it may prove feasible to
use the results to obtainmeasure of the
reaction rates in the gas mixture .heat conduction throughgas with one inert internal
the rate of energy transfer between
parallel flat plates is evaluated
when the (stagnant) gas between them is
polyatomic with one inert internal
modedeviations of the thermal
conductivity from the complete equilibrium
of the inert mode relaxation time
and the effectiveness of the walls in
exciting or de-exciting this modethe results are obtained vialinear
theory consistent with small
temperature differences between the platesit is found that the eucken-value
of conductivity could be exceeded
if the relaxation times are non-zero and
the plates very effective in
exciting the inert modewhen relaxation
times are very short the effect
of the walls on the energy transfer rate
is small, but the walls make
their presence felt by distorting the
temperature profiles in /boundary
layers/ adjacent to the walls which are
of order in thickness
time)this result is
analogous to hirschfelder's (1956) for the
case of chemical reactionsfor experimental measurement of
conductivity inhot wire cell type
of apparatus it is shown that extrapolation
of measured reciprocal
conductivities to zero reciprocal pressure
should load to the full eucken
valueit is also shown that the slope of
reciprocal apparent (measured)
conductivity versus reciprocal pressure
curves isfunction of relaxation
time as well as of the accommodation
coefficientsit is quite possible
that the relaxation effect here is
comparable with the temperature jump
effects, even for rotation in diatomic molecules .on the sudden contact betweenhot gas andcold solidthe flow induced by the sudden contact betweensemi-infinite expanse
of gas andsolid, initially at different temperatures, is examined on
the basis oflinear continuum theoryfor times large compared with
the mean time between molecular collisions in the gas, the velocity
and pressure disturbances are found to be concentrated aroundwave
front propagating out from the interface at the ambient isentropic sound
speed, whilst, near to the interface, these disturbances are small and
the gas temperatures are nearly equal to those predicted by the classical
constant pressure heat conduction theorythe possible significance of these results in connection with reflected
shock wave techniques to measure high temperature gas properties is
commented upon .the interaction ofreflected shock wave with the
ideally, the reflection ofshock
from the closed end ofshock
tube provides, for laboratory study,quantity of stationary gas at
extremely high temperaturebecause
of the action of viscosity, however,
the flow in the real case is not onedimensional,
andboundary layer
grows in the fluid following the initial shock wavein this paper simplifying assumptions
are made to allow an analysis
of the interaction of the shock reflected
from the closed end with the
boundary layer of the initial shock
afterflowthe analysis predicts
that interactions of several different
types will exist in different
ranges of initial shock mach numberit is shown that the cooling effect
of the wall on the afterflow
boundary layer accounts for the change
in interaction typean experiment is carried out which
verifies the existence of the
several interaction regions and shows
that they are satisfactorily predicted
by the theoryalong with these
results, sufficient information
is obtained from the experiments to make
possiblemodel for the
interaction in the most complicated casethis model is further verified
by measurements made during the experimentthe case of interaction withturbulent boundary layer is also
consideredidentifying the type of
interaction with the state of turbulence
of the interacting boundary
layer allows for an estimate of the
state of turbulence of the boundary
layer based on an experimental investigation
of the type of interaction .a low density wind tunnel study of shock wave structure
the profiles and thicknesses
of normal shock waves of moderate
strength have been determined
experimentally in terms of the variation
of the equilibrium temperature
of an insulated transverse cylinder in
free-molecule flowthe shock
waves were produced insteady state in
the jet oflow-density wind
tunnel, at initial mach numbers of 1.72
and 1.82 in helium and 1.78,
the shock thickness, determined
from the maximum slope of the cylinder
temperature profile, varied from
mean free path in the supersonic
streama comparison between the experimental
shock profiles and various
theoretical predictions leads to the
tentative conclusions that ..  (1)
the navier-stokes equations are adequate
for the description of the shock
transition for initial mach numbers up
to 2, and (2) the effects of
rotational relaxation times in air can be
accounted for by the introduction
of/second/ or /bulk/ viscosity coefficient
equal to about two-thirds
of the ordinary shear viscosity .some aerodynamic considerations of nozzle afterbody
the aerodynamic problems associated with propulsion-system
installations have assumedrole
of vital importance in the development of supersonic
aircraftalthough air-induction systems have received
moderate attention in the literature, considerably less
information can be found on the design and installation
of turbojet exit nozzlesthis condition should not be
interpreted to indicatelack of problems in jet-exit
designas flight speeds reach supersonic levels, it becomes
increasingly difficult to achieve nozzle installations
which are efficient over the entire speed rangethe
difficulties largely stem from the fact that the goals of
high jet thrust and low afterbody drag are not always
compatiblein many of the compromise solutions, it
is generally unsatisfactory to examine isolated nozzle
and afterbody performancerather they must be
treated asunit, and the complex effects of jet interaction
with the external stream must be taken into
accountto accomplish this, the nozzle and air-frame
designers must closely coordinate their effortssome of the aerodynamic problems of nozzle-afterbody
combinations are outlined in this reportparticular
attention is devoted to the influence of the jetstream
interaction on both nozzle thrust and afterbody
dragfor this purpose, use is made of shockboundary-layer-interaction
conceptsthis approach,
although not precise, correctly predicts many trends
and is generally enlightening .the effect ofcentral jet on the base pressure of
this report describes an experimental investigation
of the factors affecting the base flow and
jet structure behindcylindrical after-body withcentral nozzleseven interchangeable nozzles were testedsix of these were convergent-divergent, withdesign mach
number of 2.0, jet base diameter ratios ranging
from 0.2 to 0.8 and nozzle divergence angles ranging from
convergent withjet base diameter ratio of 0.6in the main experimental programme the free-stream
mach number was 2.0 and the boundary layer was
turbulent both on the after-body and in the nozzlemeasurements were made of the base pressure, the surface
pressure distribution inside the nozzle, the overall thrust
and the nozzle mass flow, overrange of jet pressuresthis programme was supplemented by comparative
tests with the jet exhausting into still air (static tests)readings were taken of the internal nozzle pressures
and the jet thrust at different jet pressuresschlieren
photography was used extensively throughoutthe results of the tests with external flow are
presented in the form of curves showing the separate effects
of jet pressure ratio, jet base diameter ratio, nozzle
design mach number and nozzle divergence angle on the
base pressure and overall thrustthe special case
of base bleed is discussed separatelysimilar curves are
included for the static teststhese show the effect
of jet pressure ratio and nozzle geometry on the jet thrusta general method of correlating data on annular
base pressures is proposed and discussedessentially, this
method compares the pressure on an annular
base with the calculated pressure on the corresponding
two-dimensional baseit correlates the present
results reasonably well, but is less successful when applied
to more extensive data .investigation at supersonic speeds of the effects of
an investigation has been conducted
in the langley 9-inch supersonic
tunnel to determine the jet effects for
varying jet mach number and nozzle
divergence angle upon the pressure
on the base annulus ofmodel withcylindrical afterbodythe tests
were conducted overwide range of
jet static pressure ratios and atreynolds number of approximately
free-stream mach numbers of 1.62, 1.94,
and 2.41all testing was conducted
with an artificially induced turbulent
boundary layer along the modelin the lower range of jet static
pressure ratios, jet flow fromsonic or supersonic nozzle affected
the pressure acting on the base annulus
in essentially the same manner
as shown in naca rm e53h25 which covers
jet static pressure ratios up to about
present results showed that the base
pressure tends to level off with
increasing jet static pressure ratio,
and at the extreme static pressure
ratios reached in tests with sonic
nozzles the base pressure began to
decreaseexcept in the lower range
of jet static pressure ratios, nozzle
divergence angle generally hadlarger effect on the base pressures
than nozzle mach number,. the increase
in base pressure forchange in
divergence angle fromto 10 was
small compared to the increase when
the divergence angle was changed from
and other data indicates that the effects
of divergence angle were reduced
when the ratio of jet exit diameter to base
diameter was decreasedjet
mach number effects increased with increase in stream mach number .experiments with static tubes insupersonic airstreamsystematic tests have been made atmach
number of 1.6 onfamily of static tubesthe variables
which have been investigated are the shape of the nose, the
distance of the holes downstream, and the inclination of
the tube to the flowpressure measurements have also been
made in the vicinity ofshock wave and close towall .base pressure at subsonic speeds in the presence of
this paper presents the results of an experimental investigation
into the effect of supersonic jets upon the base pressure ofbluff
cylinder inuniform subsonic flowthe ratio of jet diameter to base
diameter was 0.1875jet stagnation pressures giving slight under-expansion of the jet
cause an increase in the base pressure but for larger jet stagnation
pressures the base pressure is again reduceda simple theory, based onmomentum integral, shows the dependence
of the base drag upon the jet and free stream speeds and upon the
dimensions of the jet and the base .the mixing of free axially-symmetrical jets of mach number 1.40axially-symmetrical, supersonic, fully-expanded jets of diameter
about 0.75 in. and of mach number 1.40 issuing into an atmosphere
at rest were investigated by schlieren and shadow photography and
by pressure traversingthe development of the jets was found to
depend critically on the strength of the shock waves in the core of the
jet at the nozzle exitwith strong shock waves present the jet spread
very rapidly and was very unsteadythe jet did in some cases break up
into large eddies of the same size as the diameter of the jetwhen
no disturbances were present in the core of the jet the spreading
was far more gradual and the jet showed only slight unsteadinessthe turbulent mixing region of the first part of the jet with strong
shock waves was investigated in detail by pitot tubesthe first
inch was found to correspond totwo-dimensional half-jetthe
velocity profiles were similar and well represented by the error
integralthe rate of spreading was only half the value for
low-speed flowby integrations across the mixing region the
entrainment and the loss of kinetic energy were determinedthese quantities were found to agree well with the values estimated by
assuming an error-integral velocity profile .on full dispersed shock waves in carbon dioxideit is pointed out that, for shock mach numbers betweenand
that the adjustments in the energy in all the degrees of freedom
proceed slowly and in parallel and occur overdistance large
compared with the mean free paththeoretical velocity profiles
for such shock waves are given and found to be in excellent agreement
with interferometric shock-tube observations .an analysis of base pressure at supersonic speeds and
in the first part of the
investigation an analysis is made of base
pressure in an inviscid fluid,
both for two-dimensional and axiallysymmetric
flowit is shown that
for two-dimensional flow, and also for
the flow overbody of revolution
withcylindrical sting attached to
the base, there are an infinite
number of possible solutions satisfying
all necessary boundary conditions
at any given free-stream mach numberfor the particular case ofbody
having no sting attached only one
solution is possible in an inviscid
flow, but it corresponds to zero
base dragaccordingly, it is concluded
thatstrictly inviscid-fluid
theory cannot be satisfactory for practical applicationssince the exact inviscid-fluid
theory does not adequately describe
the conditions ofreal fluid flow,
an approximate semi-empirical theory
for base pressure inviscous fluid
is developed insecond part of the
investigationthe semi-empirical
theory is based partly on inviscidflow
calculations, and is restricted
to airfoils and bodies without boattailingin this theory an attempt
is made to allow for the effects of
mach number, reynolds number, profile
shape, and type of boundary-layer
flowthe results of some recent
experimental measurements of base
pressure in two-dimensional and
axially-symmetric flow are presented for
purposes of comparisonsome
experimental results also are presented
concerning the support interference
effect ofcylindrical sting, and
the interference effect ofreflected
bow wave on measurements of base
pressure insupersonic wind tunnel .boundary layer overflat plate in presence of shear
the governing equations of an incompressible
boundary layer overflat plate in the presence ofshear flow with finite vorticity are derivedfor large
vorticity,similarity solution is obtainedfor
moderate vorticity, one of the governing equations
is replaced by an approximate one for which
similarity solutions exist .some problems on heat conduction in stratiform bodiesproblems on heat conduction in multilayer bodies lead usually to complicated
calculationsthe present paper gives an idea of specific
difficulties arising in the case of infinite composite solidesgeneral deductions are applied tospecial class of questions .effect of roughness on transition in supersonic flowfurther experiments carried out in the 12-inch supersonic wind tunnel
of the jet propulsion laboratory of
the california institute of technology
to investigate the effect of threedimensional
roughness elements (spheres)
on boundary-layer transition on10
transfer are reported hereinthe
local mach number for these tests was
minimum (effective) size of trip
required to bring transition to its
lowest reynolds number varies as the
one-fourth power of the distance from
the apex of the cone to the tripuse of available data at other mach
numbers indicates that the mach
number influence for effective tripping
is taken into account by the
simple expression .properties of impact pressure probes in free molecule
an expression has been derived for the mass flow throughcircular tube in free molecule flow when the tube and gas are in
relative motionthe gas entering the tube is assumed to havemaxwellian distribution function and the molecular reflection process
at the wall is assumed to be diffusethe theory has been used to determine the pressure read
by an impact probe in free molecule flowalthough the general
expressions derived apply to any value of gas velocity and tube size,
the detailed calculations for the pressure probe are difficult except
for the case of low speeds and long tubesan experimental check of the theory has been carried out
using impact probes inwhirling arm apparatus and in the utia low
density wind tunnelagreement between theory and experiment is
quite satisfactory .scale models for thermo-aeroelastic researchan investigation is made of the
parameters to be satisfied for thermoaeroelastic
similarityit is concluded
that complete similarity obtains
only when aircraft and model are identical
in all respects, including sizeby limiting consideration to
conduction effects, by assuming the major
load carrying parts of the structure
are in regions where the flow is either
entirely laminar, or entirely turbulent,
and by assumingspecific relationship
between reynolds number and nusselt
number, an approach to similarity can
be achieved for small scale modelsexperimental and analytical work is
required to check on the validity of these assumptionsit appears that existing hot wind
tunnels will not be completely
adequate for thermo-aeroelastic work, and
accordinglypossible layout for
the type of tunnel required is describedautomatic programmed control of
the tunnel would appear to be necessary .some possibilities of using gas mixtures other than instudy is made of the advantages that can be realized in compressibleflow
research by employingsubstitute heavy gas in place of airmost heavy gases considered in previous investigations are either toxic,
chemically active, or (as in the case of the freons) haveratio of
specific heats greatly different from airthe present report is based
on the idea that by properly mixingheavy monatomic gas withsuitable heavy polyatomic gas, it is possible to obtainheavy gas
mixture which has the correct ratio of specific heats and which is
nontoxic, nonflammable, thermally stable, chemically inert, and
comprised of commercially available componentscalculations were made of wind-tunnel characteristics for 63 gas pairs
comprising 21 different polyatomic gases properly mixed with each of
three monatomic gases (argon, krypton, and xenon)forgiven
mach number, reynolds number, and tunnel pressure,gas-mixture
wind tunnel having the same specific-heat ratio as air would be
appreciably smaller and would require much less power thancorresponding air wind tunnelanalogous though different advantages
can be realized in compressor research and in firing-range researchthe most significant applications, perhaps, arise through selecting and
proportioninggas mixture so as to have at ordinary wind-tunnel
temperatures certain dimensionless characteristics which air at
flight temperatures possesses but which air at ordinary wind-tunnel
temperatures does not possesscharacteristics which involve the relaxation
time (or bulk viscosity), the variation of viscosity with
temperature, and the variation of specific heat with temperature fall
within this categoryother applications arise in heat-transfer
research since certain gas mixtures can be concocted to have any prandtl
number in the range at least between 0.2 and 0.8 .base pressure in supersonic flowthe problem of accurately predicting the pressure and wake
configuration at the base of bodies in supersonic flow is an extremely
important one inasmuch assizeable portion of the total
drag ofgiven body may be attributable to the low pressure in
this regionalthoughgreat deal of theoretical and experimental
work has been done in this field, there does not yet existsatisfactory
method for accurate predictionsthis paper represents an excellent effort to experimentally confirm
analytically deduced conceptsa large amount of experimental
data on body shapes such as wedges, cones, and conecylinders
has been obtained overrange of mach numbers up to.
the data are thoroughly discussed with respect to analytical deductionson the basis of the evidence accumulated it is concluded
that the boundary-layer thickness has onlysmall effect
on the base pressure for axisymmetric bodies and for twodimensional
bodies when the base height-to-chord ratios are of
the orderreviewer believes this report issignificant contribution in the
field of base pressure and wake flow phenomena .investigation of separated flows in supersonic and subsonic
experimental and theoretical research has been conducted on
flow separation associated with steps, bases, compression corners,
curved surfaces, shock-wave boundary-layer reflections, and configurations
producing leading-edge separationresults were
obtained from pressure-distribution measurements, shadowgraph
observations, high-speed motion pictures, and oil-film
opticsthe maximum scope of measurement encompassed
mach numbers between 0.4 and 3.6, and length reynolds
numbers between 4000 and 5000000the principal variable controlling pressure distribution in
the separated flows was found to be the location of transition
relative to the reattachment and separation positionsclassification
is made of each separated flow into one of three regimes ..
and /turbulent/ with transition upstream of separationby this means of classificaiton it is possible to state rather
literal results regarding the steadiness of flow and the influence
of reynolds number within each regimefor certain pure laminar separationstheory for calculating
dead-air pressure is advanced which agrees well with subsonic
and supersonic experimentsthis theory involves no empirical
information and provides an explanation of why transition location
relative to reattachment is importanta simple analysis
of the equations for interaction of boundary-layer and external
flow near either laminar or turbulent separation indicates the
pressure rise to vary as the square root of the wall shear stress
at the beginning of interactionvarious experiments substantiate tnis
variation for most test conditionsan incidental
observation is that the stability ofseparated laminar mixing
layer increases markedly with an increase in mach numberthe possible significance of this observation is discussed .an analysis of base pressure at supersonic velocities and
in the first part of the investigation an analysis is made of
base pressure in an inviscid fluid, both for two-dimensional and
axially symmetric flowit is shown that for two-dimensional
flow, and also for the flow overbody of revolution withcylindrical sting attached to the base, there are an infinite
number of possible solutions satisfying all necessary boundary
conditions at anh given free-stream mach numgerfor the
particular case ofbody having no sting attached only one
solution is possible in an inviscid flow, but it corresponds to
zero base dragaccordingly, it is concluded thatstrictly
inviscid-flow theory cannot be satisfactory for practical applicationsan approximate semi-empirical analysis for base pressure
inviscous fluid is developed insecond part of the investigationthe semi-empirical analysis is based partly on inviscid-flow
calculationsin this theory an attempt is made to allow
for the effects of mach number, reynolds number, profile shape,
and type of boundary-layer flowsome measurements of base
pressure in two-dimensional and axially symmetric flow are
presented for purposes of comparisonexperimental results
then are presented concerning the support interference effect
ofcylindrical sting, and the interference effect ofreflected
air wave on measurements of base pressure insupersonic wind tunnel .experimental investigation of base pressure on blunt-trailing-edge
measurements of base pressure are presented for 29 blunttrailing-edge
wings having an aspect ratio of 3.0 and various
airfoil profilesthe different profiles comprised thickness
ratios between 0.05 and 0.10, boattail angles between --2.9
and 20, and ratios of trailing-edge thickness to airfoil thickness
between 0.2 and 1.0the tests were conducted at mach numbers
of 1.25, 1.5, 2.0, and 3.1for each mach number, the reynolds
number and angle of attack were variedthe lowest reynolds
number investigated was 0.210 and the highest was 3.510measurements on each wing were obtained separately with
turbulent flow and laminar flow in the boundary layerspanwise
surveys of the base pressure were conducted on several
wingsthe results with turbulent boundary-layer flow showed only
small effects on base pressure of variations in reynolds number,
airfoil profile shape, boattail angle, and angle of attackthe
principal variable affecting the base pressure for turbulent flow
was the mach numberat the highest mach number investigated
(3.1), the ratio of boundary-layer thickness to trailingedge
thickness also affected the base pressure significantlythe results obtained with laminar boundary-layer flow to
the trailing edge showed that the effect of reynolds number on
base pressure was largein all butfew exceptional cases
the effects on base pressure of variations in angle of attack and
in profile shape upstream of the base were appreciable though
not largethe principal variable affecting the base pressure
for laminar flow was the ratio of boundary-layer thickness to
trailing-edge thicknessforfew exceptional cases involving laminar flow to the
trailing edge, the effects on base pressure of variations in profile
shape, boattail angle, and angle of attack were found to be
unusually largein such cases the variation of base pressure
with angle of attack was discontinuous and exhibitedhysteresisstroboscopic schlieren observations atmach number
of 1.5 indicated that these apparently special phenomena were
associated withvortex trail of relatively high frequency .on magnetohydrodynamic shock wavesin the earlier attempts at finding the jump conditions
acrosshydromagnetic shock wave (1, 2, 3)
various simplifying assumptions
regarding the shape of the shock and the
dimensions and the character of the
motion are madefrom that analysis it
is possible to write down the jump
conditions inhigher degree of generality (4)the shock conditions for magnetohydrodynamic
flows can, however, be
derived in their full generality with the help
of the transport equation as used by
thomas (5) in the derivation of shock conditions
in conventional gas dynamicsthe purposes of this paper are ..
cover the present more general casethat every flow and field quantity
downstream from the shock wave is
expressible separately in terms of
the known values of these quantities
upstream from the shock wavein this rearranged form of the equations,
various effects of the shock
wave can be easily read offthe shock conditions along the same
lines as in conventional gas dynamics .a theory for the core ofleading edge vortexin the flow pastslender delta wing
at incidence can be observedroughly axially symmetric core of spiralling
fluid, formed by the rolling up
of the shear layer that separates fromleading edgethe aim in this
report is to predict the flow field within
this vortex core, given appropriate
conditions at its outside edgethe basic assumptions are
corein addition it is assumed that the flow
is axially symmetric and incompressibletogether, these admit outer and inner
solutions for the core from the equations
of motionfor the outer solution the sub-core
is ignored, and the flow is taken to
be inviscid (but rotational) and conicalthe resulting solution consists of
simple expressions for the velocity components
and pressurefor the inner
solution, which applies to the diffusive
sub-core, the flow is taken to be
laminar, and approximations, some based on
the boundary conditions and some
analogous to those of boundary layer theory,
are madethe solution obtained
in this case isfirst approximation, and is
presented in tabular forma sample calculation yields results
which are in good qualitative and
fair quantitative agreement with experimental measurements .on the hypersonic viscous flow past slender bodiessimilar solution of the hypersonic viscous flow past slender bodies
of revolution is deduced forspecial case when the radial coordinate
of the body surface at sectionis proportional to x, where the radial
coordinate have the comparable order value with the thickness of the
boundary layerhere, /similar/ is used in the direct meaning that
distributions in the boundary layer keep the similar form lengthwisecalculations are accomplished for the region of strong interaction between
the boundary layer and the shock wavefrom several calculations
it may be expected that if the thickness of the body becomes small, the
thickness of the layer in which the longitudinal velocity componentis
rapidly decreased also becomes small, and in the major part of the
boundary layer, only the normal componentis increasedfurther if
the thickness of the body is increased, then, the height of the shock
wave, the pressure on the wall, and the shear stress at the wall are
also increased while the boundary layer thickness is decreasedthe
nose region is excluded by the reason that the ordinary boundary layer
theory will be invalid there .a study of inviscid flow about air foils at high supersonic
steady flow about curved airfoils at high supersonic speeds is
investigated analyticiallywith the assumption that air behaves
asdiatomic gas, it is found the the shock-expansion
method may be used to predict the flow about curved airfoils up to
extremely high mach numbers, provided the flow deflection
angles are not too close to those corresponding to shock detachmentthis result applies not only to the determination of the
surface pressure distribution, but also to the determination of the
whole flow field about an airfoilverification of this observation
is obtained with the aid of the method of characteristics by
extensive calculations of the pressure gradient and shock-wave
curvature at the leading edge, and by calculations of the pressure
distribution on10-percent-thick biconvex airfoil atangle of
attackan approximation to the shock-expansion method for thin
airfoils at high mach numbers is also investigated and is found
to yield pressures in error by less than 10 percent at mach
numbers above three and flow deflection angles up to 25this
slender-airfoil method is relatively simple in form and thus may
prove useful for some engineering purposeseffects of caloric imperfections of air manifest in disturbed
flow fields at  high mach numbers are investigated, particular
attention being given to the reduction of the ratio of specific
heatsso long as this ratio does not decrease appreciably below
to include the effects of these imperfections, should be substantially
as accurate as for ideal-gas flowsthis observation is verfied
with the aid ofgeneralized shock-expansion method andgeneralized method of characteristics employed in forms applicable
for local air temperatures up to about 5000 rankinethe slender-airfoil method is modified to employ an average
value of the ratio of specific heats forparticular flow fieldthis simplified method has essentially the same accuracy for
imperfect-gas flows as its counterpart has for ideal-gas flowsan approximate flow analysis is made at extremely high mach
numbers where it is indicated that the ratio of specific heats may
approach close to. in this case, it is found that the shock-expansion
method may be in considerable error,. however, the
busemann method for the limit of infinite free-stream mach
number and specific-heat ratio ofappears to apply with
reasonable accuracy .general theory of airfoil sections having arbitrary
in this reporttheory of thin airfoils of small camber is
developed which permits either the velocity distribution corresponding
togiven airfoil shape, or the airfoil shape corresponding
togiven velocity distribution to be calculatedthe
procedures to be employed in these calculations are outlined and
illustrated with suitable examples .correlation of theoretical and photo-thermoelastic
afterrather complete exploratory program
described in previous papers, the photothermoelastic
method was applied to the
experimental evaluation of the thermal-stress
theoriesthe new technique was correlated
with several theories which analyzed the
transient thermal stresses in idealized wing
structures of high-speed aircraftvarious
theories were investigated which represented
the same idealized wing models and differed
from each other only in the simplifying
assumptions regarding the temperature
distributions in skin and websthe theories
were evaluated by duplicating the boundary
and initial conditions on plastic models and
then by correlating the theories with the observed
fringe orders in nondimensional forma significant general conclusion was
reached after correlating the available theories
and experimental resultsowing to
simplifying assumptions concerning the thermal
behavior in the flanges, thermal
stresses predicted by the available theories are all
higher than the experimental observationin some cases the discrepancy is as great as 30 per cent .pressure distributionsaxially symmetric bodies insimple picture, known from the work of i. lotz, of the flow over
the forward part ofbody of revolution in oblique flow is derived
here from entirely elementary considerationsthe pressure at any
point of the (forward part of the) body at any angle of incidence
depends on three parameters whose values vary along the bodythe
variation of these parameters along the body can be determined fromrelatively small number of wind tunnel or water tunnel measurementsthe necessary water tunnel measurements have been made for four axially
symmetric head shapesadditional measurements have been made to
illustrate the theoretical conclusionsthe data for each head shape
are adequate fordetermination of the pressure coefficient at any
point on the head shapes at any angle of incidence (up to 6, say)in particular they can be used to determine the peak suction at any
angle of incidence and so the conditions for the onset of cavitation
on the head .pressure distributions on three bodies of revolution
this paper presents the results of an investigation conducted in
the langley 16-foot transonic tunnel to determine the effects of varying
reynolds number on the pressure distribution ontransonic body of
revolution at angles of attack through the transonic speed rangethe
effect ofchange in sting cone angle on the pressure distributions
andcomparison of experimental incremental pressures with theory is
also includedthe models were tested throughmach number range from 0.60 to 1.09the reynolds number range based on body length was fromx 10 to 39diameter was 1.310 to 4.5310 for the model atangle of attackan increase in reynolds number fromx 10 to 3910 affected
the longitudinal pressure distributions very slightlythese effects
were of suchnature as to cause an increase of 0.05 in the normalforce
coefficient of the body when tested in the subcritical cross-flow
reynolds number rangethis increase is in agreement with theoretical
approximationsa comparison between experimental and theoretical values of the
incremental pressure coefficient due to angle of attack indicated good
agreement except at angles where separated flow areas existed over the
bodythe effect ofchange in sting-cone angle fromtoon the
pressure distribution of the 120-inch model was negligible up tomach number of 1.05at this mach number the effect was to causesmall increase in the velocity over the rear of the body .investigation ofsystematic group of naca- series
an investigation has been conducted in the langley propellerresearch
tunnel to study cowling-spinner combinations based
on the naca 1-series nose inlets and to obtain systematic
design data for one family of approximately ellipsoidal spinnersin the main part of the investigation, 11 of the related spinners
were tested in various combinations withnaca open-nose
cowlings, which were also tested without spinnersthe effects
of location and shape of the spinner, shape of the inner surface
of the cowling lip, and operation ofpropeller having approximately
oval shanks were investigated brieflyin addition,study was conducted to determine the correct procedure for
extrapolating design conditions determined from the low-speed
test data to the design conditions at the actual flight mach
numberthe design conditions for the naca 1-series cowlings and
cowling-spinner combinations are presented in the form of
charts from which, for wide ranges of spinner proportions and
rates of internal flow, cowlings with near-maximum pressure
recovery can be selected for critical mach numbers ranging from
spinners and the effects of the spinners and the propeller on
the cowling design conditions are presented separately to
provide initial quantitative data for use ingeneral design
procedure through which naca 1-series cowlings can be
selected for use with spinners of other shapesby use of this
general design procedure, correlation curves established from
the test data, and derived compressible-flow equations relating
the inlet-velocity ratio to the surface pressures on the cowling
and spinner, naca 1-series cowlings and cowling-spinner
combinations can be designed for critical mach numbers as
high as 0.90 .measurement of two dimensional derivatives onwing-aileron-tab
measurements have been made of the direct
two-dimensional damping and stiffness derivatives forin incompressible flowcorrections arising from the apparatus are discussed and
reference is made to an attempt to measure the direct
tab derivativesthe effects are shown of frequency parameter, amplitude of
oscillation, reynolds number, aileron angle and position
of transition on the wingvariation with frequency parameter is substantially the
same as for vortex-sheet theory and variation of amplitude
produces little change in both derivativesat the lowest
reynolds number there is little change in both derivatives
with variation of aileron angle for the condition of natural
transition, but at higher reynolds numbers the stiffness
derivatives increase ata forward movement of transition reduces the stiffness
derivatives at the smaller aileron angles, but at,
at the lowest reynolds number, an increase resultssimilar trends are observed for the damping derivatives abovecomparison with vortex-sheet theory shows that the
measured values of the stiffness and damping
derivatives are approximately 0.6 of the theoretical valuesmeasurements have been made of the direct
tab derivatives and cross aileron-tab derivatives forper cent aileron andper cent (approx.) tabin addition
some measurements of the direct aileron derivatives have been
made for comparison with earlier results together withnumber of static derivatives for the wing and controlsthe influence is shown of frequency parameter, reynolds
number, position of transition, mean tab angle and sealing
of the control hinge gapssome tests have been made with
the ailcron set at minusdeg and the tab at plus 12 deg
for which condition the hinge moment on the aileron was zeroreasonable agreement with the values given by the /equivalent
profile/ theory is shown for both direct damping
derivatives and for the direct tab stiffness derivativethe direct
aileron stiffness derivative shows some departure from
the theoretical value whenat and the natural transition, comparison
with the values given by flat-plate theory gives the
following approximate factors, where suffix denotes the
theoretical values ..calculation of derivatives forcropped delta wing

constant-chord control hinge-moment are derived forcropped
delta wing describing harmonic plunging and pitching
oscillations of small amplitude and low-frequency parameter insupersonic air streamit is assumed that (a) the wing
has subsonic leading edges, (b) the wing is sufficiently thin
and the mach number sufficiently supersonic to permit the
use of linearised theoryexpressions for the various derivative coefficients are
obtained forparticular delta wing of aspect ratio 1.8 and
taper ratio these are avaluated and tabulated for mach
numbers 1.1, 1.15, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 1.5, 1.6 and 1.944 .supersonic flow past oscillating airfoils includingsolution to second order in thickness is derived for harmonically
oscillating two-dimensional airfoils in supersonic
flowfor slow oscillations of an arbitrary profile, the result is
found asseries including the third power of frequencyfor
arbitrary frequencies, the method of solution for any specific
profile is indicated, and the explicit solution derived forsingle
wedgenonlinear thickness effects are found generally to reduce the
torsional damping, and so to enlarge the range of mach numbers
within which torsional instability is possiblethis destabilizing
effect varies only slightly with frequency in the range involved
in dynamic stability analysis, but may reverse tostabilizing effect at high flutter frequenciescomparison withprevious solution exact in thickness suggests that nonlinear
effects of higher than second order are practically negligiblethe analysis utilizessmoothing technique that replaces
the actural problem by one involving no kinked streamlinesthis stratagem eliminates all consideration of shock waves
from the analysis, yet yields the correct solution for problems
that actually contain shock waves .aircraft flutterthe term flutter is used here to denote maintained or
violent oscillations ofstructure due to aerodynamic forces
acting in conjunction with both elastic and inertial forcesattention is restricted to this particular branch of the more
general field of aeroelasticity, which embraces buffeting,
divergence, and reversal of control, as well as flutter,. airscrew
flutter is not specifically consideredthe monograph is
divided into three main parts, each of which has been made
self-contained for the convenience of readersin the first part, general methods for the investigation
of aircraft flutter, by theoretical analysis and by experiments
on flutter models, are set out and discusseda detailed
account of the aerodynamic theory of wings in non-uniform
motion is not included, since this has already been provided
elsewhere, but methods for the evaluation of the aerodynamic
forces required intheoretical flutter analysis are logically
developed, andbibliography of researches on the aerodynamic
theory is given in the appendixinvestigations
on specific types of aircraft flutter--namely wing flutter,
control surface flutter, and tab flutter--are discussed in part
these various types of flutter are considered, but the practical
details of flutter-prevention devices are omittedfinally,
in part 3, methods for the experimental determination of
airloads on oscillating aerofoil systems are described, and
available airload measurements are analysed and compared
with theoretical resultsan attempt has been made to refer in the text to all relevant
british work reported by the early part of 1947foreign
work has been mentioned in partsandonly where necessary
for the sake of completeness, but in partand the
appendix all relevant foreign references known to the author have
been includedmatrix notation has been used for the theoretical treatment in
part 1, but otherwise its use has been avoided .calculated velocity distributions and force derivatives
the polygon method of woods is used to
calculate the velocity distribution overnumber of twodimensional
aerofoils at low incidence, subcritical flows only
being consideredlift slopes and aerodynamic centres
at zero lift are also calculatedsome comparisons with experimental results are made, and
these show good agreement at zero incidence .a study of the application of airfoil section data
estimates of the variation with
mach number of the aerodynamic
characteristics of swept wings are made
on the basis of airfoil section
data combined with span-loading theorythe analysis deals with examinations
of some 26 wings and wing-body
combinations ranging in sweep
angle from 30 to 60 and for mach
numbers between 0.6 and 1.0results of the study indicate
that the two-dimensional section data
afford good qualitative information
for such high-speed aerodynamic
characteristics as the variation with
mach number of drag, zero-lift
pitching-moment coefficient, and lift
coefficient for flow separationquantitative estimates of the force
and moment divergence mach numbers
could not be made with any degree of
certainty from the airfoil data
alonesomewhat improved quantitative
estimates forgiven configuration
were obtainable by basing the
estimates on the measured characteristics
forwing of similar plan form
but different section, and adjusting
for the effects of differences in
section on the basis of section data .a correlation of airfoil section data with the aerodynamic
an investigation has been made of the possibility of correlating
airfoil section data with measured pressure distributions over45
sweptback wing in the mach number range from 0.50 to 0.95 atfreestream
reynolds number of approximatelymillionthe wing had an aspect ratio
of 5.5,taper ratio of 0.53, naca 64a010 sections normal to the
quarterchord line, and was mounted onslender body of revolutionat mach numbers of 0.85 and below, and for wing normal-force coefficients
below the maximum normal-force coefficient for an infiniteaspect-ratio
wing yawed 45 to the flow (derived from airfoil section
data by simple sweep relations), good correlation was obtained over most
of the wing between wing-section and two-dimensional-airfoil pressure
distributionsfor greater normal-force coefficients lateral boundarylayer
flow permitted the inboard wing sections to rise to high maximum
section normal-force coefficientsthe effectiveness of this lateral
boundary-layer flow disappeared towards the tipfor all mach numbers,
the influence of plan-form effects on the pressure distributions limited
the quality of the correlation at the 20- and 95-percent-semispan
stationsabovemach number of about 0.85 the shock waves originating
at the juncture of the body and the wing trailing edge spread over
the span, preventing further application of two-dimensional datathe spanwise load distributions at moderate normal-force coefficients
could be predicted from span-loading theory for the entire mach number
range of the tests .the applications of the polygon method to the calculation
this paper sets out the method now used by the author of
applying the polygon method to the calculation of the compressible
subsonic flow round two-dimensional aerofoilstables have been
constructed which can be used for all aerofoil shapes, putting the
polygon method on the same footing numerically as goldstein's
method has the advantage over approximationthat it can be applied in
the following cases which are beyond the scope of goldstein's method ..
conventional aerofoils, (b) the low-speed flow about very thick
aerofoils, e.g., in referenceit is applied to circular cylinders, (c)
the flow about symmetric aerofoils between either straight or constant
pressure walls, (d) flow in asymmetric channels,
and (e) more difficult problems
of the flow about aerofoils in the presence
of one or two constraining
walls (to be published)a method of
calculating lift and moment
coefficients, and their rates of change
with incidence (a) is also
given in the paperas an example the velocity distribution and the rates of
change of the lift and moment coefficients withare calculated for
the aerofoil r.a.e.104 at values of(mach number at infinity) of 0,
and 0.7, for various values of the incidence,.  the velocity
distributions for zero incidence are found to be in fair agreement with
the corresponding experimental resultsthe results at incidence are
in satisfactory agreement with the experimental results, not for the
same incidence, but for the same lift coefficientit is found, for
example, that at= 0.7 the theory for= 0.8 agrees best
with experiment for= 1.0, when the lift coefficients are
approximately the same .laminar boundary layer oscillations and transition
this is an account of an investigation in which oscillations
were discovered in the laminar boundary layer alongflat platethese oscillations were found during the course of an experiment
in which transition from laminar to turbulent flow was being
studied on the plate as the turbulence in the wind stream was
being reduced to unusually low values by means of damping
screensthe first part of the paper deals with experimental
methods and apparatus, measurements of turbulence and
sound, and studies of transitiona description is then given
of the manner in which oscillations were discovered and how
they were found to be related to transition, and then how controlled
oscillations were produced and studied in detailthe
oscillations are shown to be the velocity variations accompanyingwave motion in the boundary layer, this wave motion having
all the characteristics predicted bystability theory based on
the exponential growth of small disturbancesa review of this
theory is giventhe work is thus experimental confirmation
ofmathematical theory of stability which had been in the
process of development forperiod of approximately 40 years,
mainly by german investigators .the hall effect in the viscous flow of ionized gas
the electrical conductivity of an ionized
gas is anisotropic in the presence
of magnetic field (hall effect)the conductivity is expressed bytensor in the same form for both fully
and partially ionized gasesby
the use of modified ohm's law and
conventional magnetohydrodynamical
equations the incompressible viscous
flow between parallel plates under
the transverse magnetic field is analyzed
and an exact solution is obtained
when the magnetic reynolds number
is smallthe numerical results
revealremarkable effect of anisotropy
of conductivitythe acceleration
and deceleration of viscous ionized
gas under combined electric and
magnetic fields are also calculated .boundary layer induced noise in the interior of aircraftat high speeds the turbulent boundary layer washing the
airplane fuselage excites appreciable skin vibration, promoting strong
noise in the interiorthe fluctuating exciting pressure distribution
can be represented aspattern of moving waves (fourier integral)a running ripple in the skin follows underneath each wave, and the noise
is ultimately due to these ripplesthe acoustic effects of the running ripples are calculated
for an infinite sheet,. this is considered the main result of the
papersupersonically moving ripples radiate strong sound in the form
of mach waves,. subsonically moving ripples radiate no soundformulas
for the mean square surface pressure and the energy flux are obtained
for an assumed idealized turbulent pressure spectrumthe results are adapted to providetentative estimate of
the noise generated at subsonic speeds inpractical fuselagethe
running ripples are almost noise-free, but multiple reflections at the
frames and stringers promote standing wavesan assumption is used
to link the two kinds of waves, and this leads to provisional
calculations of noise level ..  on this basis the noise level is
predicted to vary as for thin boundary layers, changing
progressively to for thick layers= external air
density,speed,layer thickness,panel thickness)some
comparisons are made with experimentfinally, an idea for
minimizing the noise is presented .propeller in yawit was realized as early as 1909 thatpropeller in yaw

expressed this force in terms of the torque coefficient for the
unyawed propellerof several attempts to express the side
force directly in terms of the shape of the blades, however, none
has been completely satisfactoryan analysis that incorporates
induction effects not adequately covered in previous work
and that gives good agreement with experiment overwide
range of operating conditions is presented hereinthe present
analysis shows that the fin analogy may be extended to the form
of the side-force expression and that the effective fin area may
be taken as the projected side area of the propellerthe effective
aspect ratio is of the order ofand the appropriate dynamic
pressure is roughly that at the propeller disk as augmented by
the inflowthe variation of the inflow velocity, forfixedpitch
propeller, accounts for most of the variation of side force
with advance-diameter rationdthe propeller forces due to an angular velocity of pitch are
also analyzed and are shown to be very small for the pitching
velocities that may actually be realized in maneuvers, with the
exception of the spinfurther conclusions are ..dual-rotating propeller in yaw
develops up to one-third more side force thansingle-rotating
propellera yawed single-rotating propeller experiencespitching moment in addition to the side forcethe pitching
moment is of the order of the moment produced byforce equal
to the side force, acting at the end oflever arm equal to the
propeller radiusthis cross-coupling between pitch and yaw
is small but possibly not negligiblethe formulas for propellers in yaw derived herein (with the
exception of the compressibility correction) andseries of
charts of the side-force derivative calculated therefrom have been
presented without derivation in an earlier report .effect of slight blunting of leading edge of an immersed
manufacturing and maintainance of ideally sharp leading edges
and noses is practically impossible, hencediscrepancy arises
between the theory established for sharp edges and actual flow
around slightly blunted edges, wheredetached shock is formed
withsubsonic adjacent regionsemi-empirical method is worked
out showing that the pressure distribution in the vicinity of the
leading edge is the same for different thin profiles having the same
shape of bluntness on their edges or nosesthe data forflat
plate can be used for all of themfor moderate supersonic speed
the pressure on the remaining body is practically unaffected by the
nose bluntness, and can be computed fromsharp-edge theoryfor high supersonic speedslight blunting of the edge can considerably
alter the pattern of flow overlarge regionthe method
consists in replacing blunted edge by action of concentrated
forces on the flow,. it is applied to blunted wedge where it shows
doubling of the drag computed by classic theory, and to cones,
where the drag ofblunted cone may become smaller than that ofsharp one .theory and tunnel tests of rotor blade for supersonic
in special circumstances wherelarge work
output is required fromturbine insingle stage
it is necessary to use high pressure ratios across the
nozzle blades, thus producing supersonic velocities at
inlet to the rotoras part of an investigation into such
turbines, several designs for the inter-blade passages of
the rotor have been tested intwo-dimensional tunnel,design theory being developed concurrentlythe first design, featuring constant passage width
and curvature as in steam-turbine practice, but having
thin leading and trailing edges, was found to suffer from
focusing of the compression waves from the concave
surface, with consequent flow separation from the
opposite convex surfaceit gavevelocity coefficient of
measured at an inlet mach number of 1.90 and turning
angle of 140 degthe measured value compares favourably
with values from previous steam tests, where the
results have been in the range from 0.65 to 0.92from theoretical reasoning, and from additional test
observations,subsequent passage was designed
having an inlet transition length of small curvature, leading
tofree-vortex passage of double the transition
curvature,.small amount of contraction was incorporatedschlieren photographs showed the flow in this
passage to be almost shock freea thin region of low-energy
air existed close to the convex surface, but liquidinjection
tests located only one small bubble of reversed flowpressure traverses at exit indicatedvelocity
coefficient of 0.952, based on the area-mean total pressurewhen allowance is made for turning angle and
reynolds number this result appears to compare quite favourably
with previous workit would seem that the optimum blade pitching inturbine
would be about 20 to 30 per cent closer than intwo-dimensional cascadehowever, the resultant pitching
tends to become very close, except at very large
turning angles, with the result that in some applications
difficulties could arise in the practical design and
manufactureseveral uncertainties remain and the present design must be regarded
as still experimental .the performance of supersonic turbine nozzlesan investigation has been conducted
at the national gas turbine establishment into the
performance of turbines having high pressure ratios
per stagethe present report discusses the mode of
operation of supersonic nozzles for such turbines,
and describescascade experimentboth theory and
experiment demonstrate that the conditions imposed
upon the supersonic flow immediately downstream
of the nozzles (e.g., byfollowing row of rotor blades)
exert an overriding influence upon the nozzle outlet
flow angle, and hence upon the maximum pressure
ratio obtainable across the nozzle--providing that the
axial component of velocity is subsonicthis is an
important difference from the more familiar flow of
subsonic turbine nozzles, where, for example, the
downstream gas angle is controlled predominantly by the
nozzle blade shape and spacinga suitable test technique
usingclosed-jet tunnel is demonstratedthe particular nozzles tested, of convergent-divergent
form, hadstraight-sided divergent portion of
to axial direction) anddesign mach number of.
the flow was found to be well behaved as regards shock
pattern, losses, and starting over the range of pressure
ratios tested--between1 and 19.  in particular the
efficiency at the design pressure ratio of 16.6was
high, the velocity coefficient calculated from traverses of
pitot and static tubes being 0.98for the conversion of pitot to total pressure atmach
number of 2.5high accuracy is important in the
measurement of the static pressure,. nevertheless readings
fromconventional four-hole instrument appear to
be reliable .on the testing of supersonic compressor cascadesto facilitate the development of high speed axial-flow compressors,
an investigation was made into the possibility of measuring blade performance
instationary cascade at supersonic speedsa suitable
technique was developed and the losses invariety of cascades were
measured, but these losses were too high for the blading to have any
possible applicationit was concluded that ifuseful compressor is
to result, it is essential to test the cascades at mach numbers close to
the existing technique was suitable only for zero incidence tests, and
thusnew approach is necessarysome of the fundamentals of this cascade testing at low supersonic
speeds are discussed in the light of the current understanding of the
mode of operation of supersonic compressors at transonic speeds .the test performance of highly loaded turbine stagesblade design forhighly loaded two-stage
turbine is described and the test performance of
the turbine is presentedsome of the factors affecting the performance and matching
of turbine blade rows operating at supersonic
gas velocity are discussed and investigated by means of tests
onthree-dimensional nozzle cascade tunnel
and onvariety of single-stage turbine builds .the supersonic axial flow compressoran investigation has been made to explore the possibilities of
axial-flow compressors operating with supersonic velocities into
the blade rowspreliminary calculations showed that very
high pressure ratios acrossstage, together with somewhat
increased mass flows, were apparently possible with compressors
which decelerated air through the speed of sound in their
bladingthe first phase of this investigation, which has been
reported in naca acr l5d20, was the development of efficient
supersonic diffusers to decelerate air through the speed of soundthe present report is largelygeneral discussion of some of the
essential aerodynamics of single-stage supersonic axial-flow
compressorsin the supersonic flow about isolated bodies,
large energy losses usually occur due to wave systems which
extend far from the bodiessupersonic flow enteringcascade
is considered and, in this case, the possibility of entirely eliminating
this extended wave system is demonstrated,. thus, no
reason for supersonic compressors to be necessarily inefficient
is apparentthe conditions that occur as the flow through the
compressor is being started are discussed andhypothesis as
to the type of transonic flow which will be encountered is
proposedas an approach to the study of supersonic compressors, three
possible velocity diagrams are discussed brieflybecause of
the encouraging results of this study, an experimental singlestage
supersonic compressor has been constructed and tested in
freon-12in this compressor, air decelerates through the
speed of sound in the rotor blading and enters the stators at
subsonic speedsa pressure ratio of about 1.8 at an efficiency
of about 80 percent has been obtained .flow pattern inconverging-diverging nozzlethe present report describesnew method for the prediction
of the flow pattern ofgas in the two-dimensional and axially
symmetrical caseit is assumed that the expansion of the gas is
adiabatic and the flow stationarythe several assumptions
necessary on the nozzle shape effect, in general, no essential
limitation on the conventional nozzlesthe method is applicable
throughout the entire speed range,. the velocity of sound itself
plays no singular partthe principal weight is placed on the
treatment of the flow near the throat ofconverging-diverging
nozzlefor slender nozzles formulas are derived for the calculation
of the velocity components as function of the location .intensity, scale and spectra of turbulence in mixing
the intensity of turbulence, the longitudinal and lateral correlation
coefficients, and the spectra of turbulence in3.5-inchdiameter
free jet were measured with hot-wire anemometers at
exit mach numbers from 0.2 to 0.7 and reynolds numbers fromthe results of these measurements show the following ..  (1)
near the nozzle (distances less thanorjet diam downstream
of the nozzle) the intensity of turbulence, expressed as percent
of core velocity, ismaximum atdistance of approximately
increasing mach and or reynolds numberat distances greater
thanjet diameters downstream of the nozzle, however, the
maximum intensity moves out and decreases in magnitude until
the turbulence-intensity profiles are quite flat and approaching
similarity(2) the lateral and longitudinal scales of turbulence
are nearly independent of mach and or reynolds number
and in the mixing zone near the jet vary proportionally with
distance from the jet nozzle(3) farther downstream of the
jet the longitudinal scale reachesmaximum and then decreases
approximately linearly with distance(4) near the nozzle the
lateral scale is much smaller than the longitudinal and does not
vary with distance from the centerline, while the longitudinal
scale ismaximum atdistance from the centerline of about
mum moves out from the centerline(6)statistical analysis
of the correlograms and spectra yields/scale/ which, although
different in magnitude from the conventional, varies similarly
to the ordinary scale and is easier to evaluate .on the strength distribution of noise sources along
the spatial distribution of noise sources alongjet is
investigated by application of lighthill's
theory to regions of 'similar'
profilesthe analysis refers to the
noise power emitted by'slice' of
jet (section between two adjacent planes
normal to the axis) asfunction
of distanceof the slice from the nozzleit is found that this power
is essentially constant within the initial
mixing region (x law), then
further downstream (sayor 10 diameters
from the nozzle) falls off
extremely fast (x law or faster) in the
fully developed jetbecause
of this striking attenuation of strength
with distance, it is concluded that
the mixing region produces the bulk of
the noise and must dominate in
muffler behavior,. conversely, the 'fat'
part of the jet must contribute
much less to the total noise power than is commonly supposedpowell's experiments on the effects of nozzle velocity profile
on total noise power are interpreted
qualitativelythe behavior of
multiple-nozzle or corrugated mufflers,
both as to overall quieting and
frequency-shifting, is also interpreted
in the light of the resultsthe
possibility emerges that such mufflers
may be improved without serious
thrust loss by the addition ofsound-attenuating shroud .a general purpose analogue correlator for the analysis oflarge proportion of the current research programme of the
department of aeronautics and astronautics is concerned with the
study of jet noise and boundary layer pressure fluctuations and
their effect on aircraft structuresearly in the work it was
decided that forcomplete description of the random processes
involved it would be necessary in the experimental programme to
make correlation measurements in addition to the more standard
spectrum and amplitude distribution measurementsit was also
felt that it would be desirable from the university point of view
to constructgeneral purpose correlator which could later be
used on other types of workto this end it was decided to give
the correlatorwider bandwidth than might strictly have been
necessary for the problems on handsubsequent development work
has amply justified this decision .a theoretical study of annular supersonic nozzlesthis paper is concerned with the design
of annular supersonic nozzles to produce uniform
flow in supersonic wind tunnels which are axi-symmetrical
and which have an internal coaxial circular cylinder
throughoutsymmetrical two-dimensional and conventional
axi-symmetrical nozzles are special cases of
annular nozzlesproposals are made for design criteria sufficient to
ensure that the flow insidenozzle is free from limit
lines and shock waves,. the criteria for (symmetrical)
two-dimensional and (conventional) axi-symmetrical
nozzles are newthe two outstanding procedures for
designing two-dimensional and axi-symmetrical nozzles
are generalised to apply to annular nozzlesone of the
design procedures is mainly analytical and the other is
mainly numerical,. the analytical expressions in both
procedures are made much more complicated by the
presence of the internal cylinder but the numerical process
criteria and the mainly numerical design procedure are
successfully applied to the design ofparticular
annular nozzle .the flow over delta wings at low speeds with leadinglow speed investigation of the flow over40 apex angle delta
wing with sharp leading edges has been made in order to ascertain
details of the flow in the viscous region near the leading edge of the
suction surface of the winga physical picture of the flow was
obtained from the surface flow andsmoke
technique of flow visualization,
combined with detailed measurements of total
head, dynamic pressure, flow
directions and vortex core positions in the flow above the wingsurface pressure distributions were also measured and integrated
to give normal force coefficientsthe results of this investigation were compared with those of other
experimental investigations and also with various theoretical resultsin particular, the normal force coefficients, vortex core positions and
attachment line positions were compared with the theoretical results of
mangler and smith, reference 19it was found that ..
exist on the upper surface of the wing outboard of and below
the main vorticesthese secondary vortices are formed asresult of separation of the boundary layers developing outboard
of the top surface attachment lines .a note on the theory of the stanton tubeexisting theories for the stanton tube are
critically reviewed, and the paper then outlinessimple method which predicts the calibration function
at high reynolds numbers to the right order of
magnitude .quasi-cylindrical surfaces with prescribed loadingsformula for the velocity field in terms ofgiven surface distribution
of vorticity is applied to points
lying on the surfacean equation

examplehalf ring wing with prescribed
loading is discussed .elliptic cones alone and with wings at supersonic speedsto help fill the gap in the knowledge
of aerodynamics of shapes
intermediate between bodies of revolution
and flat triangular wings, force
and moment characteristics for elliptic
cones have been experimentally
determined for mach numbers of 1.97 and
sectional axis ratios fromthroughand with lengths and base areas
equal to circular cones of fineness
ratios 3.67 andhave been studied
for angles of bank ofand 90elliptic and circular cones in combination
with triangular wings of aspect
ratiosand 1.5 also have been consideredthe angle-of-attack range
was fromto about 16, and the
reynolds number was 8x10, based on
model lengthin addition to the
forces and moments at angle of attack,
pressure distributions for elliptic
cones at zero angle of attack have been determinedthe results of this investigation
indicate that there are distinct
aerodynamic advantages to the use of
elliptic coneswith their major
cross-sectional axes horizontal, they
develop greater lift and have higher
lift-drag ratios than circular cones
of the same fineness ratio and volumein combination with triangular wings
of low aspect ratio, they also develop
higher lift-drag ratios than circular
cones with the same wingsfor
winged elliptic cones, this increase
in lift-drag ratio results both from
lower zero-lift drag and drag due to
liftvisual-flow studies indicate
that, because of better streamlining
in the crossflow plane, vortex flow
is inhibited more for an elliptic cone
with major axis in the plane of the
wing than forcircular cone with the
same wingasresult, vortex
drag resulting from lift is reducedshifts in center of pressure with
changes in angle of attack and mach
number are small and about the same
as for circular conescomparisons of theoretical and
experimental force and moment characteristics
for elliptic cones indicate
that simple linearized (flat plate)
wing theory is generally adequate even
for relatively thick coneszerolift
pressure distributions and drag
can be computed using van dyke's
second-order slender-body theoryfor winged circular cones,modification
of the slender-body theory of
naca rep. 962 results in good agreement
of theory with experiment .aerofoil theory offlat delta wing at supersonic
lift, drag, and pressure distribution oftriangular
flat plate moving atsmall incidence at supersonic
speeds are given for arbitrary mach number and aspect ratiothe values obtained for lift and drag are compared with
the corresponding values obtained by strip theorythe
possibility of further applications of the analysis leading up
to the above results is indicated .a technique for improving the predictions of linearised
the curve of drag against mach number for straight-edged wings,
calculated by using the linearised theory of supersonic flow, displays
discontinuities in slope at the various mach numbers for which the edges
are sonicthese features, which are not observed in practice, are due
to the fact that linearised theory predicts an infinite pressure alongsubsonic or sonic edgeit is shown that if the linearised equation
of supersonic flow is used to determine the flow over straight-edged
wings, but the linearised boundary condition is replaced by the full
placed by plausible valueson this basissimple method is derived
for improving the linearised predictions of the drag of straight-edged
wings which exhibits satisfactory agreement with experimental resultswhile the technique is not directly applicable to ridge lines, an
artifice renders them amenable to similar treatment .navier-stokes solutions at large distances fromfinite bodythis paper is concerned withtheoretical investigation of the flow
field at large distances from an object moving throughviscous fluidthe discussion will be restricted to the case of two-dimensional
stationary incompressible flowthe object will be assumed to be of
finite sizethe domain of the fluid is infinite and it is assumed
that there are no other boundaries for the fluid except that of the
given objectthe reynolds number will be assumed to havefixed
value., thus we shall not consider the limiting cases of the reynolds
number tending to zero or to infinity .interference between the wings and tail surfaces of
the interference between the wings and the tail surfaces ofcombination of circular body, low aspect ratio cruciform wings and
cruciform tail in an inviscid flow is analysed using the slender body
theorythe system may be subjected to both incidence and yaw and,
in general, the tail fins may be staggered angularly with respect to
the main wingsthe method isdevelopment of that used by owen and maskell in
r.a.e. report no. aero.2441 to analyse similar effects onsystem set
at zero yawsimple expressions to determine the strengths and positions of
the trailing vortices (supposed to be rolled-up) downstream of the main
wings are given, and from them the forces on the tail are deducedwhen the tail surfaces are triangular and of low aspect ratio an exact
solution is obtained from slender body theory ..  but for rectangular
tail surfaces of moderate or high aspect ratio, it is suggested that the
changes in lift and sideforce on the tail caused by the wing vortex
field can be estimated approximately from the mean upwash and sidewash
angles evaluated over the respective tail spansformulae for these
means angles are presented .interference between the wings and tail plane ofan approximate method of predicting the interference between
the wings and the tailplane ofslender wing-body-tailplane combination
in an inviscid flow is developed, in order to explain the change
in centre of pressure position with incidence which has been found to
occur in wind tunnel and flight tests on guided weaponsincidence
changes in one plane only, normal to the plane containing the wings
and the tail surfaces, have been consideredthe method is based on slender body theory and the assumption
that the wing trailing vortices roll-up completely before they reach
the tailplane,. it is, therefore, applicable to weapons equipped with
low aspect ratio wings far separated from the tail surfaceswhen
the tail surfaces are triangular and of low aspect ratio, an analytical
solution is given for the effect of the wing downwash field on
the tail liftfor high aspect ratio, rectangular tail surfaces it
is suggested by comparison with experimental data, that the tail lift
may be estimated approximately from the value of the mean downwash
angle across the tail spana summary of the method is given in para.5 which, in conjunction
with the introduction, may be read independently of the rest of the
report .practical calculation of second-order supersonic flow

routine computationuse of an approximate tangency condition is shown
to increase the accuracy for bodies with cornerstables of basic
functions and standard computing forms are presentedthe procedure is
summarized so that one can apply it without necessarily understanding
the details of the theorya sample calculation is given, and several
examples are compared with solutions calculated by the method of

compared with standard values obtained
by the method of characteristics

second-order theory appreciably
extends the range of accurate applicationthe second-order theory gives
good results on ogives when the ratio of
the tangent of maximum surface
angle to the tangent of the mach angle
is less than 0.9tangent-cone
method cannot be widely applied with
good accuracyin general, the
conical-shock-expansion theory predicts
pressure and drag within engineering
accuracy when the hypersonic similarity
parameter is greater than 1.2although newtonian theory gives good accuracy,
except for cones, at the
highest values of the hypersonic similarity
parameter investigated, it is
less accurate than the conical-shock-expansion theory .the theoretical wave drag of some bodies of revolutionthis report investigates the wave drag of bodies
of revolution with pointed or open-nose forebodies
and pointed or truncated afterbodiesthe 'quasi-cylinder'
and 'slender-body' theories are reviewed,reversibility
theorem is established, and the concept of the interference
effect offorebody on an afterbody is introducedthe theories are applied to bodies whose profiles are either
straight or parabolic arcs, formulae and curves being
given for forebody and afterbody drag, and for the interference
dragthe results of the two theories are compared
and are seen to agree well in the region of geometries where both
theories are applicable .a second order shock-expansion method applicable tosecond-order shock-expansion

noninclined bodies are derived by the
use of characteristics theory in
combination with properties of the flow

shock-expansion methodthis result is
extended to inclined bodies to
obtain expressions for the normal-force
and pitching-moment derivatives
at zero angle of attackthe method is
intended for application under
conditions between the ranges of applicability

are compared with experimental
results for mach numbers from 3.00 to 6.28fineness ratio 7, 5, andcones and tangent ogives were tested alone
and with cylindrical afterbodies

predictions of the present method
are found to be in good agreement with the
experimental resultsfor noninclined

predicted with the method are in
good agreement with existing experimental
results and with distributions
obtained with the method of characteristicsfor inclined bodies, the
normal-force derivatives per radian (for
normal-force coefficients referenced
to body base area) are predicted
within 0.2 and the locations of
the center of pressure are predicted

an example is constructed to illustrate
the method and to give an indication of its accuracy .criteria for thermodynamic equilibrium in gas flowwhen gases flow at high velocity, the rates
of internal processes may not be fast enough to maintain
thermodynamic equilibriumby defining
quasi-equilibrium in flow as the condition in which
the temperature, pressure, density, and velocity
deviate by less thanfixed, small percentage from
what they would be if the flowing gas could actually
be in thermodynamic equilibrium, criteria are
derived for determining whether quasi-equilibrium
isstable condition in the flowby use of excitation
of molecular vibration as an example, the
general properties of criteria curves are discussed and
interpreteda discussion is given of how to use
these results to determine definitely whetherflow

calibrated in the no.1 and the no.2 11 ft8 ft wind tunnels of the
r.a.e., usinglong static tube, the error of which is believed to be
very small, asstandard for comparisonthe results show that the static pressure measured by these tubes
is in error due to the supporting strut and to the nose shape of the
tube by an amount which may be calculated for positions of the static
slot, or holes, greater than 10 tube diameters ahead of the strutthe
readings show no measurable scale effect in the speed range 100-230 ft
secthe static tube is insensitive to yaw in the rangewithsquare-edged slot and is even less sensitive to yaw when the slot edges
are roundedthe turbulence of the tunnel has an effect on the static
pressure reading .a theoretical analysis of heat transfer in regions of separated flow
the flow field analyzed consists ofthin, constant pressure
viscous mixing layer separated fromsolid surface by an enclosed
region of low-velocity air (/dead air/)the law of conservation of
energy is employed to relate calculated conditions within the
separated mixing layer to the rate of heat transfer at the solid surfacethis physical speed is applied to laminar separations in
compressible flow for various prandtl numbers, including consideration
of the case where air is injected into the separated regionapplication to turbulent separations is made forprandtl number of
unity in low-speed flow without injectionall calculations are for the case of zero boundary-layer thickness at
the position of separationfor laminar separations the differential equations for viscous flow
at arbitrary mach number are solved for the enthalpy and velocity
profiles within the thin layer where mixing with dead air takes placeresults are presented in tabular form for prandtl numbers between 0.1

an approximate theory of the base pressure in two-dimensional flow
at supersonic speeds is presented using asimplified representation of
the flow and some of the findings of tollmien's work on turbulent mixing
in incompressible flowgood qualitative predictions of the effects ofboundary layer, of bleed air and of boat-tailing are obtained .investigation with an interferometer of the turbulent
the free turbulent mixing ofsupersonic jet of mach number
of whichdescription is given, was used for the investigationdensity and velocity distributions through the mixing zone
have been obtainedit was found that there was similarity
in distribution at the cross sections investigated and that, in
the subsonic portion of the mixing zone, the velocity distribution
fitted the theoretical distribution for incompressible flowit was found that the rates of spread of the mixing zone both
into the jet and into the ambient air were less than those of
subsonic jets .an improved smoke generator for use in the visualisation
and rapid method by which boundary
layer flow was rendered visible has been
previously described in the journal of the royal
aeronautical societyit gave promise of
being useful at the highest tunnel speeds provideddenser smoke could be obtained, which at
the same time was free from the troublesome deposits
associated with the wood smokeof the aerodynamics division attempts were made
by the fuel research station to improve the
density of the wood smoke and to reduce the
depositsthese they showed were conflicting
requirements, and whilst some improvement
was effected, it was not sufficient for observation
in the new tunnels at high speedsthe staff of the director-general of scientific
research and development, ministry of supply,
was then approached and it was decided to
develop an oil smoke generator fromsimple
generator of this type which was demonstrated
to usthis has been done successfullythe final apparatus in contrast to the wood smoke
generator is light and compactit takes
onlyfew minutes to start and can be run as long as desiredimprovement on the wood smoke both as regards
density and freedom from deposits, which cause
premature transitionthe density and quality
of the smoke are now under controlsmokes
ranging fromlight smoke of bluish white colour
toheavy smoke dense white in appearance
can be obtainedthe oil smoke retains the
advantages of the wood smoke in that it is noncorrosive
and non-irritant, and the smell can be
tolerated even when it is present inconsiderable
concentrationa certain amount of condensation
is inevitable with oil smokes, but with suitable
precautions troubles arising from this can be

rapidit would greatly assist the interpretation
of force measurements and the more detailed
explorations of the boundary layer by total

particularly suited for educational work in small
demonstration tunnels .the ground effect on the jet flap in two dimensionsthis paper presents the results of the first part of an
experimental investigation of the ground effect on simple jet flap
aerofoilsin this part of the work an aerofoil having58.1 deg jet
flap was tested under two-dimensional conditionsthe pressure lift on the aerofoil was measured, with the ground
at fixed positions, for varying jet momentum coefficientsit was
found that the effect of the ground on the pressure lift was very small
up tocertain critical jet coefficienton increasing the jet
coefficient beyond the critical valuemarked loss of pressure lift was
observedthis critical value referred to is approximately the same as
the jet coefficient at which the jet first hits the groundsome significant, though highly tentative comments, are made
regarding the practical application of this work to the take-off
characteristics ofjet flapped aircraft .the design of minimum drag tip finswith an appendix
the report describes an investigation into
the design of minimum drag tip fins by lifting line theorythe
work is based on an exact solution of the conformal
transformation which is applicable to this problem following the
method of trefitzthree types of solution are treated,
corresponding to symmetrical upper and lower fins, single
upper or lower fins, and unequal upper and lower finsa representative range of solutions for circulation distribution
along wing and fins has been calculated for each of the
three cases by the use of elliptic and theta functionsa detailed account is given, with examples, of the
procedure for calculating the plan of wing and fins, the lift and
induced drag, and the setting of the fins .the calculation of the pressure distribution on thick
the method of expressing the velocity increment
over aerofoils directly in terms of the section ordinates
wings of finite aspect ratiothe wings considered are
untapered in plan-form but may be tapered in thicknessthe section can be of any given shape so that in this sense
the analysis is more general than that of refs.towhich
deal with wings of biconvex sectionthe coefficients required in the calculation are tabulated
for the centre-section of straight and swept-back wings
of aspect ratios 0.5,. 1,. 2,. and 4, the wing of infinite
aspect ratio having been
treated in ref..  the remaining calculations can be made
very quicklysince wings of very small aspect ratio can be treated also by
the method of slender-body theory, the relations between
linear theory, slender-body theory, and linearised slender-body
theory are discussedfor the special case of ellipsoids,
the results obtained from the various methods are compared
with the exact solution .the application of lighthill formula for numerical
an integral expression, given by lighthill and based
on linearized theory, for the external
supersonic flow over the surface of slender pointed
or ducted bodies of revolution at zero
angle of attack is shown to givegood approximation
of the exact flow formuch wider mach
number and thickness range than could be expected from
linearized theorya numerical method,
based on this expression, is developed and applied for
digital computingsome results from
applying the digital computing procedure for determining
the pressure distribution and wave
drag for various bodies of revolution are given .formulae for the computation of the functions employed
in order to determine the velocity distribution
about an arbitrary aerofoil, it is necessary to evaluate
the functions and (in the notation of aerofoil theory)
when is given numericallyif the values of are specified
at 2n points equally spaced about the circle into which the
aerofoil is transformed, the formulae obtained here may be
used to calculate these functions at the same pointsformulae are also given for calculating the integrals of or,
since these have application to the design of aerofoils by
thwaites's numerical methodthe simplicity of the formulae for and enables
the effect on the velocity distribution oflocal change of shape
readily to be determined by makinglargethis is
discussed in.the formulae are collected in the appendix, andtable
of the coefficients for the case= 20 is given .pressure distributions at zero lift for delta wings
the linearised theory of thin wings is used to calculate pressure
distributions over delta wings with rhombic cross sectionsa deuce
programme has been written for the calculation and some of the results
are compared with those of slender thin wing theory .a collection of longitudinal stability derivativescollection has been made of
theoretical data, for wings alone, on
those stability derivatives that govern
the short-period oscillation of
aircraft travelling at supersonic speedsall the derivatives available
have been obtained by means of the linear
theory, and so the information
given is subject to the usual limitationsthe information has been
presented in what is hoped is the most
convenient form to show its extent,
and to expose the parts of the field
where experimental investigation is
most needed .an investigation of interference effects on similar models of
details are given ofprogramme of tests being made on similar sweptwing
models in transonic tunnels of different typesforce measurement
results at subsonic speeds in the r.a.e.ft. byft. slotted tunnel
show only small interference effects for models of moderate blockage
at low incidence., at higher incidences, the interference effect on
lift becomes appreciably greater than estimated by theory, and
significant pitching moment differences occur, apparently due to wall
interference on the wing flow fieldcomparable but smaller effects
are evident in the results from the a.r.a.ft. byft. perforated
tunnelat speeds just above= 1, the force fluctuates as speed
is increased, because of wave reflection interferencethe magnitude
of the fluctuations diminishes as speed is further increased and this
reduction is more marked in the perforated tunnelpressure
measurements along the top of the body at zero incidence show delay in
shock movements at high subsonic speeds indicatingblockage effect
on speed., the effect is larger in the perforated tunnel though
smaller than predicted by theoryabove= 1, both expansion and
shock waves are strongly reflected in the slotted tunnel but
considerable alleviation, particularly of shock waves, is achieved
in the perforated tunnel, for which an analysis of the effects is
given, showing for example, the effect of the open-area distribution of
the walls .on the ground level disturbance from large aircraft
the whitham-walkden theory for the estimation of the strength
of shock waves at ground level from aircraft flying at supersonic
speeds is applied to the case oftypical projected supersonic civil
transport aeroplaneiffigure oflb sq.ft. (includingfactor offor ground
reflection) is taken as an upper limit for the acceptable strength of
the bow wave from such an aircraft it is shown that restrictions on
the climb and flight plan will be involvedthe advantage of the
employment of larger engines with or without afterburning is discussed,
with reference also to the penalties involved owing to the increase in
weight of the aircraft and its direct operating costsfinally it is suggested that an aircraft of given volume could be
designed, by suitable choice of thickness and lift distribution, to
minimise the strength of the shock waves in the far field .boundary layers with suction and injectiona review
available data on the effects of suction and injection on skin
friction are summarised and comparedit is shown that injection intoturbulent boundary layer can
produceskin friction coefficient lower than the laminar value at the
same reynolds number on an impermeable plate .an approximate solution of the turbulent boundary layer
if over the 'outer region' of the boundary layer, where the mean
velocity varies but little from its value outside the shear layer,virtual eddy viscosity is defined, which is constant over the outer
region but varies in the direction of the mainstream,solution of the
turbulent boundary layer equations can be found which satisfies the
appropriate boundary conditionsthe solution leads tocompatibility
condition for the virtual eddy viscosity in terms of the wall shear
stress, the boundary layer momentum thickness and the mainstream
velocity, at least for the case ofconstant external velocitythis
compatibility condition, which can be expressed as
for moderate to high reynolds numbers, where is the shear velocity,
is the boundary layer thickness and is the virtual eddy (kinematic)
viscosity, is just the condition townsend (1956) found for the
equilibrium of the large eddiesthe numerical value of the constant
derived by townsend agrees with ours for reynolds numbers (based on x)
of aboutwith this relation for an equation, analoguous to the
momentum integral equation solution, can be found for asfunction of
local freestream velocity, with one disposable parameter .an experimental study of the glancing interaction between
an experimental study has been made at mach numbers from 1.6 to 2.0 of
the interaction between the turbulent
boundary layer onside wall ofwind
tunnel and the shock wave produced byplate mounted on the wallunder
these conditions the shock wave boundary
layer interaction was three
dimensional at least over the region
investigated (up to 10 boundary layer
thicknesses from the plate)it was
found that the boundary layer was separated
byshock wave of strength
type occur on the sides of fuselages at
the wing fuselage junction and may
therefore be important with regard to the
design of waisted shapes .on turbulen flow between parallel platesthe reynolds equations of motion of turbulent flow of
incompressible fluid have been studied for turbulent
flow between parallel platesthe number of these equations
is finally reduced to twoone of these consists of
mean velocity and correlation between transverse and
longitudinal turbulent-velocity fluctuations onlythe other consists of the mean pressure and transverse
turbulent-velocity intensitysome conclusions about
the mean pressure distribution and turbulent fluctuations
are drawnthese equations are applied to two special
cases ..  one is poiseuille flow in which both plates are
at rest and the other is couette flow in which one plate is at
rest and the other is moving with constant velocitythe
mean velocity distribution and the correlation can
be expressed inform of polynomial of the co-ordinate in
the direction perpendicular to the plates, with the ratio
of shearing stress on the plate to that of the corresponding
laminar flow of the same maximum velocity asparameterthese expressions hold true all the way across the
plates, i.e., both the turbulent region and viscous layer
including the laminar sublayerthese expressions for
poiseuille flow have been checked with experimental data
of laufer fairly wellit also shows that the logarithmic
mean velocity distribution is notrigorous solution of
reynolds equations .the effect of turbulence on slider bearing lubricationbased on prandtl's mixing-length mechanism, the pressure
equation for turbulent flow in
slider-bearing lubrication is derivedan analytical
solution is given and compared with
the one for laminar flowit is found that the turbulent
effect increases the pressure and
consequently, the load-carrying capacityhowever, the
power loss also increases .second order theory for unsteady supersonic flow
the thermodynamic properties (zpv rt,rt,rt,r,
and pressure) are given for equilibrium mixtures of dissociated and
ionized molecules and atoms of the elements nitrogen and oxygen
having the low temperature composition of .78847and .21153.
the tabulated properties of this mixture (a close approximation to
the properties of air) are given at close intervals from 2000 to
and 10 times the normal densitythe results are based on chemical
equilibria between the species o, o, n, n, no, no, no,
no, o, o, o, o, n, n,and electronsthe method of
presentation permits later corrections for the effect of argon and co
and the contribution of intermolecular forcesthe calculations are
based on 9.758 e.v. as the dissociation energy of molecular nitrogen
and 1.45 e.v. as the electron affinity of atomic oxygen .a critical review of skin friction and heat transferreview is made of existing literature concerned with
the analytical investigation of the velocity and temperature
distributions in the boundary layers ofheated (or
cooled) flat platethe plate is postulated infinitely thin
and is parallel touniform fluid streamthe more recent
solutions include the combined effects of frictional
dissipation and variable fluid propertiesonly the results
pertaining to the transfer phenomena occurring at the
plate surface are included, i.e., skin drag and over-all
heat transfer,. the individual temperature and velocity
distributions leading to these results are omitted .experiments on axi-symmetric boundary layers along
experiments on axi-symmetric boundary
layers alonglong cylinder were made especially
to investigate the effect of transverse
curvature on the velocity profilelaminar
velocity profiles were measured and compared
with theoretical ones with good accuracya representative profile was plotted to see the
effect of transverse curvature, which showed
small, but obvious effect accompanied by
increasing skin frictionthe transition of the flow from laminar to
turbulent was observed, and its reynolds
number was estimated to occur at 1.2 1.8x10
in the present experimentthe turbulent
profile was also measured and plotted by using
the coordinates to express the wall law
deduced by richmond, from which it was
estimated that, as the ratio of the momentum
thickness to body radius increases, the profile
near the outer layer tends to bend down
relative to the line of logarithmic wall law .the formation ofblast wave byvery intense explosionthis paper was written early in 1941
and circulated to the civil defence research
committee of the ministry of home security
in june of that yearthe present writer
had been told that it might be possible
to producebomb in whichvery large
amount of energy would be released by
nuclear fission--the name atomic bomb had
not then been used--and the work here
described represents his first attempt to form
an idea of what mechanical effects might
be expected if such an explosion could occurin the then common explosive bomb mechanical
effects were produced by the sudden
generation oflarge amount of gas athigh
temperature inconfined spacethe
practical question which required an answer
was ..  would similar effects be produced
if energy could be released inhighly
concentrated form unaccompanied by the
generation of gas .qm  this paper has now
been declassified, and though it has been
superseded by more complete calculations,
it seems appropriate to publish it as it was
first written, without alteration, except for
the omission offew lines, the addition of
this summary, andcomparison with some
more recent experimental work, so that
the writings of later workers in this field may be appreciatedan ideal problem is here discusseda finite
amount of energy is suddenly released
in an infinitely concentrated formthe motion
and pressure of the surrounding air is
calculatedit is found thatspherical shock
wave is propagated outwards whose
radiusis related to the timesince the explosion
started by the equation
where is the atmospheric density,is
the energy released anda calculated
function of, the ratio of the specific heats of airthe effect of the explosion is to force most
of the air within the shock front intothin shell just inside that frontas the front
expands, the maximum pressure decreases
till, at about 10 atm., the analysis ceases
to be accurateat 20 atm. 45 of
the energy has been degraded into heat which is
not available for doing work and used
up in expanding against atmospheric pressurethis leads to the prediction that an
atomic bomb would be only half as efficient, asblast-producer, ashigh explosive
releasing the same amount of energyin the ideal problem the maximum pressure is
proportional to r, and comparison
with the measured pressures near high explosives,
in the range of radii where the two
might be expected to be comparable, shows that
these conclusions are borne out by
experiment .cylindrical shock waves produced by instantaneous energy
taylor's analysis of the intense spherical explosion
has been extended to the cylindrical caseit is found
that the radiusofstrong cylindrical shock wave
produced bysudden release of energyper unit length
grows with timeaccording to the equation
where is the atmospheric density and
iscalculated function of the specific
heat ratiofor is found to be approximately
unityfor this case, the pressure behind the
shock wave decays with radiusaccording to the relationapplying the results of this analysis
to the case of hypersonic flight, it can be shown that
the shock envelope behindmeteor orhigh-speed

whereanddenote the total
drag and the velocity of the missile, respectively,
andis the distance behind the missile .asymptotic solution of the two dimensional oscillatingnew method has been given, for obtaining asymptotic solutions ofboundary value problem for the wave equationthe method is simpler
than the method previously given by burger, and leads toresult
identical with burger's result .some instabilities arising from the interaction betweenbrief review is made of the available information concerning
the flow fluctuations and instabilities arising from shock-induced
separation in the flow over aerofoils and wingsthe influence this
phenomenon has on the oscillatory behaviour of aerofoils and control
surfaces is also briefly discusseda more detailed consideration is devoted torecent investigation
at the n.p.l. into the part played by shock-induced separation in the
instability ofcontrol surface .exact solution of the neumann problemcalculation
an exact general method of solving
the neumann or second boundary-value
problem has been developed and has been
applied to the calculation of lowspeed
flows about or within bodies of
almost any shape, provided the flow is
either plane or has axial symmetrysolid-body, inlet, and purely internal
flow problems can be solvedthe
method is capable of dealing with several
bodies at once in the presence of
one another, and consequently interference
problems can be treated with easeboundaries need not be solid, that is,
flows involving area suction can be
calculatedvelocities can be computed
not only for points on the surface of
the body but for the entire flow fielda surface source distribution is
used asbasis for solutionthis
leads tofredholm integral equation
of the second kind, which is solved asset of linear algebraic equations,
usually bymodified seidel methodat the present time the solution is
programed on the ibm 704 edpm to solve
the flow about any body that has the
previously mentioned characteristics
and whose profile can be defined
satisfactorily by no more than 300 coordinate
pointsa number of solutions
are presented, to show both the scope
of the method and its accuracycomputations require from three minutes
to two hours, depending upon the
shape of the body and the number of points
used to define it .steady and transient free convection of an electrically
an analysis is made for the laminar
free convection and heat transfer ofviscous electrically conducting fluid
fromhot vertical plate in the case
when the induced field is negligible
compared to the imposed magnetic fieldit is found that similar solutions for
velocity and temperature exist when
the imposed magnetic field (acting
perpendicular to the plate) varies inversely
as the fourth root of the distance from
the lowest end of the plateexplicit
expressions for velocity, temperature,
boundary layer thickness and nusselt
number are obtained and the effect
ofmagnetic field on them is studiedit is found that the effect of the
magnetic field is to decrease the rate of
heat transfer from the wallin the
second part, the method of characteristics
is employed to obtain solutions of
the time-dependent hydromagnetic free
convection equations (hyperbolic) of
momentum and energy put into integral
formthe results yield the time required
for the steady flow to be established,
and the effect of the magnetic field on this time is studied .several magnetohydrodynamic free-convection solutionsthe influence of transverse magnetic fields on
the laminar free-convection flow of liquid
metals oververtical flat plate and between
vertical parallel plates is examined for
specific wall temperature variations and
prandtl numbersthe extent of influence on
the flow and temperature fields is determined
by the magnitude ofnondimensional influence
parameter which is the ratio of the
magnetic force to the buoyant forcein general,
increasing the magnetic field strength
decreases the magnitude of the velocity, wall
shear, and surfaces heat transfer and
increases the temperature throughout the fluidanalytical results demonstrate that magnetic
fields of practical strengths exert considerable
influence on liquid metal free-convection flow fields .onlaminar free-convection flow and heat transfer
the free-convection flow and heat transfer of an
electrically conducting fluid onvertical
plate in the presence oftransverse magnetic
field is analysed formagnetic field
fixed to the electrically non-conducting wallthe
boundary layer equations for selfpreserving
flows are integrated numerically for the
prandtl number of unity, and the effect
of the transverse magnetic field on the velocity
profile, temperature profile and rate of
heat transfer is discussedit is concluded that
the heat transfer rate is reduced as the
magnetic field intensity is increased .on combined free and forced convection laminar magnetohydrodynamic
combined free and forced convective heat transfer
in vertical channels has been studied by many researchersdue to the need for engineering design
information there have been many papers concerning
cases of fully developed flow with varying wall temperatureforced flows inchannel of electrically
conducting fluid withtransverse magnetic field
have been studied and the large effects ofmagnetic
field on the flow pattern have been establishedflows of combined free and forced convection in
electrically conducting fluids in vertical channels
withtransverse magnetic field are expected to attract
attention in future engineering applications, for
example, inmagneto-hydrodynamic generator or in
plasma studieshowever, except forreport by
gershuni and zhukhovitskii (1) concerningparticular
case, no general study has been publishedthis paper isgeneral treatment of fully developed,

discussion of various turbulent-boundary-layer theories, in
the light of experimental measurements by matting and co-workersthe application of (1) the mager insulated-wall transformation, and
and illustrated graphically .oscillatory aerodynamic coefficients forunified supersonic
the shock tube is shown to befeasible research tool for conducting
boundary-layer transition experimentsthe use of the
shock tube permits the study of transition with highly cooled
boundary layers, as may be encountered on hypersonic vehiclesboundary-layer transition investigations have been made on
optically polished pyrex hemisphere-cylinder and ellipse-cylinder
models with stagnation-to-wall enthalpy ratios between 4.5 and
roughness estimated to be less thanmicroinch (rms)transition
was detected by measurements of the heat-transfer rates on
the model surfacethe shock tube experiments indicated thatcharacteristic
feature of transition ofhighly cooled boundary layer onhemisphere
was the simultaneous occurrence of transition over the
entire supersonic portion of the hemispherethis implies that
transition first occurred in the sonic regionthe transition
reynolds number (based on local fluid properties at the outer
edge of the boundary layer and the momentum thickness) in the
sonic region increased from about 225 to 325 as the stagnation-towall
enthalpy ratio increased from about 9.5 to 29.5transition
occurred along the cylindrical portion of the hemisphere-cylinder
model atnearly constant momentum thickness reynolds
number, increasing from about 400 to 625 as the stagnation-towall
enthalpy ratio increased from about 9.5 to 29.5the highly cooled boundary layers obtained on the cylindrical
portion of the shock tube hemisphere-cylinder model provided an
extension of nasa transition results obtained oncooled hemisphere-cone-cylinder
model inwind tunnelthe transition
reynolds numbers obtained from these shock tube data were of
the same order of magnitude as the minimum transition reynolds
numbers obtained in the wind-tunnel experimentsthe
results indicate that, for practical purposes, boundary-layer
cooling is notcritical transition parameter for blunt bodies withhighly cooled boundary layer resulting fromstagnation-towall
enthalpy ratio of aboutto 30that is, the transition
reynolds number did not vary significantly with boundarylayer
cooling in this cooling range, but transition always occurred
atlow reynolds number (between about 350,000 and 750,000
based on local external properties anddistance along the body
surface from the stagnation point)the boundary-layer history (body shape history) appeared to
be an important parameter affecting the magnitude of the reynolds
number for transition and the amount of increase in the
transition reynolds number with increased boundary-layer
coolingthat is, transition occurred atlower reynolds number
on the ellipse-cylinder configuration than on the hemispherecylinderalso, the increase in transition reynolds number with
an increase in boundary-layer cooling was even less significant
for the ellipse-cylinder than the hemisphere-cylinder .flow past slender blunt bodiesa review and extensiona numerical solution of the inviscid flow field about slender blunt
bodies of revolution has been developed throughcombination of two
methods ..  the van dyke solution in the subsonic flow
region at the nose, and the method of
characteristics in the supersonic regionthe results are compared with secondorder
blast wave theory and with experimental
data,. and the respective merits and
deficiencies of the two theoretical methods
are pointed outthe results of the
numerical solution are further used indiscussion of the entropy layer, to
proposepossible criterion of entropy layer thickness .analysis of quartz and teflon shields forparticular
the transient performance of
ablation type heat protection shields is
treated herein for the surface ofvehicle returning from outer space to the
earththe vehicle weighs 8640 kg,
hasballistic factor of 500 lb ft, reenters
withspeed of 11 km sec at
ratio of 0.5, and is subjected tomaximum deceleration of 7.7 times the
gravity constantby use of well known equations
for the heat transfer and the mass transfer
atheated surface,numerical
calculation method is derived which, for
the investigated ablation processes,
yields exact transient solutions of the
fundamental system of partial differential
equationsthe method is applied
to various quartz shields and to one
teflon shield, which all evaporate so
readily under the conditions of the
problem at hand that practically no flow
of molten shield material existsthe solutions also show comparatively small
temperature changes parallel to the surfacethe results show that the nose
of the vehicle is cooled predominantly by
the evaporation of the quartz or the
teflon,. the rest of the vehicle's surface
is cooled by radiation of the quartz
or evaporation of the teflonthe large
mass transfer effects on the nose of
the vehicle are detrimental since the resulting
low surface temperatures prevent
the radiative heat transfer out of
the shield, which does not involve any
mass loss, from being the desirable
governing cooling factor .the effect of lift on entry corridor depth and guidance
corridors for manned vehicles are
defined consistent with requirements
for avoiding radiation exposure and for
limiting values of peak decelerationuse of lift increases the depth
of the entry corridormid-course
guidance requirements appear to be critical
only for the flight-path angleincreasing the energy of the transfer orbit

from the center of the earth .reaction tests of turbine nozzles for supersonic velocitiesa machine for testing turbine nozzles by the reaction
method, which was described inprevious paper, was
used to testseries of convergent-divergent turbine
nozzlesthe results of these tests, along with the test
ofconvergent turbine nozzle, are compared with each
other and with analytical valuestwo kinds of analytical
values are employed, namely, the usual values obtained
from an assumed isentropic expansion from inlet state to
exhaust pressure, and the values obtained from the assumption
that the processes in the nozzle are isentropic
except fornormal shock which takes upposition in the
nozzle such as to cause the stream to fill the exit area at
the exhaust pressure whenever possiblethis latter kind
of analytical value involves no shock when the exit area can
be filled at the exhaust pressure by means of isentropic
processes only, or when the exhaust pressure is lowered
so far that the shock has passed out of the passagethe
agreement of the test results with the calculated results
of this latter kind is good, and the disagreement which
exists can be attributed largely to separation at the shock
and to transmission of exhaust-pressure effects upstream
through the boundary layer .study of flow conditions and deflection angle at exit
an analysis was made of the flow conditions downstream ofcascade of turbine rotor blades at critical and supercritical pressure
ratiosthe results of five theoretical methods for determining
the deflection angle are compared with those of an experimental
method using the conservation-of-momentum principle and staticpressure
surveys, and also are compared with an analysis of schlieren
photographs of the flow downstream of the bladesa twodimensional
cascade of six blades with an axial width of 1.80 inches
was used for the static-pressure surveys and for some of the schlieren
photographsin order to determine the flow conditions several
blade chords downstream of the cascade, schlieren photographs were
taken of the flow throughcascade of 18 blades having an axial
width of 0.60 inchfor the blade design studied, even at static-to-total pressure
ratios considerably lower than that required to give critical velocity
at the throat section, the flow was deflected in the tangential
direction as predicted for the incompressible caseas the pressure
ratio was lowered further, the aerodynamic loading of the rear portion
of the blade reachedmaximum value and remained constantafter this condition was attained, the expansion downstream of the
cascade took place withconstant tangential velocity so that no
further increase in the amount of turning across the blade row and
no further increase in the loading of the blade was available .on source and vortex distributions in the linearised
the hyperbolic character of the differential
equation satisfied by the velocity
potential in linearized supersonic flow entails
the presence of fractional infinities
in the fundamental solutions of the equationdifficulties arising from this fact can
be overcome by the introduction of hadamard's
finite part of an infinite integraltogether with the definition of certain counterparts
of the familiar vector operators
this leads tonatural development of the analogy
between incompressible flow
and linearized supersonic flowin particular, formulae
are derived for the field of
flow due to an arbitrary distribution of supersonic
sources and vorticesapplications to aerofoil theory, including the
calculation of the downwash in the
wake of an aerofoil, are given inseparate report (ref. 9) .supersonic drag calculations forcylindrical shellsemi-circular ring wing withbody of revolution on
the axis is studied to find the wave and the vortex drag for
various chordwise lift distributions and for three values ofparameter describing the wing geometryusing the
wave drag obtained from the chordwise loading that gives the
least drag, together with the vortex and skin friction drags,
the maximum lift to drag ratio for each wing geometry is
computedcompared to the estimates made by lomax and heaslet,
somewhat lower drags are found .the surface oil flow technique as used in high speed
an examination has been made of the
various versions of the surface oil
flow technique used in different high speed
wind tunnelsto provide background
information for this investigation
some systematic tests were made onsimple model insmall supersonic tunnelthe experience gained made it
possible to explain many of the variations
in terms of the different operating
conditions of the tunnelsthe time taken to formpattern
ontypical model is, tofirst
approximation, directly proportional to
the value of the parameter,
the factor being 36,000 12,000the
time taken appears to be independent
of the initial thickness of the oil sheeta general procedure for the development
of oil mixtures for any purpose
is suggested .higher order approximations for relaxation oscillationsthe problem of solving asymptotic developments for all quantities
involved in relaxation oscillations has been solved by haagthis
paper indicates how one can carry out such developments incase
which is simple enough to be treated explicitly .jet effects on base pressure of conical afterbodies
data are presented which show the effect ofjet on base pressure
forseries of conical afterbody-jet-nozzle combinations having boattail
angles that varied fromto 11 and base-to-jet diameter ratios
that varied from 1.11 to 2.67the jet nozzles had exit angles fromto 20 and were designed for exit mach numbers from 1.0 to 3.2pressure
ratios up to 30 were tested for bothcold (air) andhot
numbers of 1.91 and 3.12in general, base pressure increased for increasing values of boattail
angle, nozzle angle, jet temperature, and jet total pressure and
for decreasing values of base-to-jet diameter ratio, jet mach number,
and free-stream mach numberthe addition of tail surfaces produced
only small changes in base pressurefor all variables, base pressure is governed by the maximum pressure
rise that can be supported by the wake fluid in the region of the
trailing shockthe wake pressure ratio is in turn governed by the jet
and free-stream mach numbers adjacent to the wake region and by the
state of the boundary layer on the boattail and on the nozzlevalues of wake pressure ratio computed using the theory of korst,
page, and childs were in good agreement with experimental values for
convergent nozzles .laminar heat transfer around blunt bodies in dissociatedmethod of predicting laminar heat-transfer rates to blunt,
highly cooled bodies with constant wall temperature in dissociated
air flow is developedattention is restricted to the case of axisymmetric
bodies at zero incidence, although two-dimensional
bodies could be treated the same waythe method is based on
the use of the /local similarity/ concept and an extension of the
ideas used by fay and riddella simple formula is given for
predicting the ratio of local heat-transfer rate to stagnation-point
rateit depends on wall conditions and pressure distribution,
but not on the thermodynamic or transport properties of the hot
external flow, except at the stagnation pointexperimental heat-transfer rates obtained with correct stagnation-point
simulation and high wall cooling in shock tubes are
also presented and compared with the theoretical predictionson the whole, the agreement is good, although in regions of rapidly
varying pressure there is evidence that the local similarity
assumption breaks down, and the theory underestimates the
actual heat-transfer rate by up to 25 per cent .the divergence of supersonic wings including chordwise
the static aeroelastic stability or divergence problem is investigated
for thin supersonic wings when not only the spanwise
bending and twist are taken into account but also the chordwise
bendingthe problem is treated in successive phases of increasing
complexity from the two-dimensional curling-up of the
leading edge to the three-dimensional stability of the cantilever
wingseveral methods of approach are developed including
the nonlinear aspects of the structure and the aerodynamicsresults indicatestrong dependence of stability on poisson's
ratio and the magnitude of the deformation .on the flutter of panels at high mach numbersthere have recently arisen some questions as to the
possibility of panel flutter at high dynamic pressures and
mach numbersin addition, some doubts have been raised
about the convergence of the galerkin method when applied to
such problemsthis note is intended to shed light on these
matters .effect of roll on dynamic instability of symmetric
this note attempts to extend the discussion by statingslightly neater form of generalized stability conditions and describing
certain experimental results on dynamic instability .some theoretical low-speed loading characteristics
the weissinger method for determining additional span
loading for incompressible flow is used to find the damping in
roll, the lateral center of pressure of the rolling load, and the
span loading coefficients caused by rolling for wing plan forms
of various aspect ratios, taper ratios, and sweep anglesin
addition, the applicability of the method to the determination
of certain other aerodynamic derivatives is investigated, and
corrections for the first-order effects of compressibility are
indicatedthe agreement obtained between experimentally and theoretically
determined values for the aerodynamic coefficients
indicates that the method of weissinger is well suited to the
calculation of the additional span loading caused by rolling
and for the calculation of such resulting aerodynamic derivatives
of wings as do not involve considerations of tip suction .the rolling up of the trailing vortex sheet and its
the motion of the trailing vortices associated withlifting wing
is investigated by theoretical and visual-flow methods for the
purpose of determining the proper vortex distribution to be used
for downwash calculationsboth subsonic and supersonic speeds
are considered in the analysisit is found that the degree to which the vortices are rolled up
depends upon the distance behind the wing and upon the lift
coefficient, span loading, and aspect ratio of the wingwhile the
rolling up of the trailing vortices associated with high-aspectratio
wings is of little practical importance, it is shown that, with
low-aspect-ratio wings, the trailing vortex sheet may become essentially
rolled up into two trailing vortex cores withinchord
length of the trailing edgethe downwash fields associated with the two limiting cases of
the flat vortex sheet and the fully rolled-up vortices are investigated
in detail for both subsonic and supersonic speedsthe
intermediate case in which the rolling-up process is only partially
completed at the tail position is also discussed .a theoretical study of the aerodynamics of slendertheoretical study is made of some cruciform-wing arrangements
and their wakes by means of slender-body theorythe
basic ideas of this theory are reviewed and equations are developed
for the pressures, loadings, and forces on slender cruciform
wings and wing-body combinationsthe rolling-up of
the vortex sheet behindslender cruciform wing is considered
at length andnumerical analysis is carried out using 40
vortices to calculate the wake shape at various distances behind
an equal-span cruciform wing at 45 bankanalytical expressions
are developed for the corresponding positions of
the rolled-up vortex sheets using4-vortex approximation to
the wake, and these positions are compared with the positions
of the centroids of vorticity resulting from the numerical analysisthe agreement is found to be remarkably good at all distances
behind the wingphotographs of the wake as observed inwater tank are
presented for various distances behindcruciform wing atand 45 bankfor 45 bank, the distance behind the wing
at which the upper two vortices pass between the lower two is
measured experimentally and is found to agree well with thethe calculation of loads on cruciform tails is considered in
some detail by the method of reverse flow, and equations are
developed for the tail loads in terms of the vortex positions
calculated in the earlier analyses .dynamic stability ofmissile in rolling flightthe paper sets down the equations of motion forsymmetric
rolling missile with respect to axes attached to the missilethe
missile may be jet (or rocket) propelled or coasting under accelerating
or decelerating conditions, respectively, wherein the variable
rolling velocity is derived from intentionally or unintentionally
/canted/ fins and or wingsthe equations containforce and moment system that includes,
in addition to the usual forces and moments, those due to
magnus effects, misaligned surfaces, canted surfaces, jet misalignment,
and the linear accelerations in the plane normal to the missile
axisthe results present general stability criteria forrolling missile
which are summarized in the /discussion of stability ./sweepback effects in the turbulent boundary-layer shock-wave
experiments are reported on the interaction of turbulent
boundary layers and shock waves with sweptback configurationsthey show that the peak pressure rise at separation, the upstream
influence ahead of separation, and the pressure rise at reattachment
for moderate sweep angles can all be understood by
simple extensions of available two-dimensional theories .rapid laminar boundary layer calculations by piece-wisemethod is presented for the rapid calculation of the incompressible
laminar boundary layer in an arbitrary flow around
eithertwo-dimensional orrotationally-symmetrical bodythe solution is obtained without recourse to von karman's
momentum equation by means ofcoarse step-by-step procedure
in which each segment of the velocity distribution is approximated
by one of the falkner-skan family of similar flowssolutions have at least as much accuracy as those of any other
one-parameter approximate method, and in certain cases the
solutions become exactin regions of accelerating velocity, the
accuracy appears to be very highin decelerating flows, separation
is predicted somewhat early compared with exact solutions
that is, the method is conservative in contrast to the von
karman-pohlhausen procedure which sometimes fails to predict
separation that actually existsthe method is the most rapid hand procedure known to the
author, provided the full history of the boundary layer is requiredif onlythickness such as is needed at one point onsurface, then it is about equal in speed to the quadrature methodbut, if several values of or other properties alongsurface are
required, it is appreciably faster than the quadrature methodcharacteristically, only four steps are needed between the forward
stagnation point and the pressure peakonce the velocitydistribution
data are available, each step intwo-dimensional
calculation requires aboutminutes, usingslide rule .recent studies on the effect of cooling on boundary
the advent of high-speed flight has necessitated the study of
boundary-layer transition on highly cooled bodiesinvestigations
such as those of references 1-4 have concentrated
on this problem and have indicated, contrary to the trends
predicted by small-disturbance theory, that premature transition
can be found with coolingthis phenomenon, commonly called
detail in references 2-5the purpose of this note is to report some recent transition
data obtained oncooled cone inmachwind tunnelthe
model,sharp-tip cone (included angle 13.5), was cooled by
liquid nitrogen totemperature of -340.  the cooling
method and the data analysis are similar to that described in
reference.an investigation of laminar transitional and turbulent
laminar, transitional, and turbulent heating rates have been
measured by means of the shrouded model techniquethe
reynolds number was varied overninefold range,. the enthalpy
ratio (stagnation to wall) varied from 2.3 to approximately 1.5two different pressure distributions were imposed on the model
which consisted ofspherically capped conethe experimental data are compared to the laminar hypersonic
boundary-layer theory and shown to be in good agreement on the
conical portion of the modelon the spherical portion the data
are approximately 20 per cent higher than the theoretical predictionsome of this discrepancy can be attributed to radiation to
the nose of the modelthe fully developed turbulent heat-transfer data are compared
to two theories ..  (1)relatively simple turbulent theory which is
based on recent theoretical work and which takes into account
the upstream history of the boundary layer, and (2) the flat-plate
reference-enthalpy theory, which depends on only /local/ conditionsalthough both theories are in reasonable agreement with
the data, the latter method is simpler and somewhat more accuratefor transitional flow the theory mentioned first can be readily
modified in order to permit reasonable estimates of transitional
heat transfer to be obtainedon this basis it is possible to estimate
laminar, transitional, and fully developed turbulent heat
transfer under hypersonic blunt-body conditionsthe behavior of transition reynolds number based on momentum
thickness is also discussed and shown to be in quantitative
agreement with recent shock-tube measurements .a note on transitional heat transfer under hypersonic conditionsin referencesandthere were presented experimental data on
transitional heat transfer onblunt body under hypersonic-flow
conditions obtained by the shroud techniquethe data were compared
withtheoretical prediction of transitional heat transfer based
onsuggestion of pershthe agreement between theory and experiment
in the transitional region was found to be 'qualitatively good and
quantitatively fair'it is the purpose of this note to present some additional transitional
data obtained in conventional wind-tunnel tests and to indicatemeans for improving somewhat the agreement between transitional
theory and experiment .notes on waves through gases at pressures small compared
most treatments of magnetohydrodynamic
waves have confined physical interpretation
to cases when the alfven velocityis small compared with the sound
velocity.  here we consider the 'low-beta
situation', in whichis much
larger than.  then, except for two modes with
wave velocitythe only possible
waves are longitudinal ones, propagated
unidirectionally along lines of magnetic
force with velocity.  these can be
interpreted as sound waves, confined to
effectively rigid magnetic tubes of forcehall-current effects do not alter these
conclusions (in contrast to the high-beta
situation), and finite conductivity
introduces only small dissipationan application is made to the flow pattern
aroundbody moving through thelayer of the ionosphere, where, although
neutral particles havevery large
mean free path, charged particles interact
electrostatically and, it is argued, may
be regarded as formingcontinuous fluid
whose movement is independent of
that of the neutral particlesa body moving
at satellite speed or below would
then excite the above-mentioned unidirectional
sound waves, but no waves at
much faster alfven velocitythese considerations
suggest that its movement
would be accompanied byv-shaped pattern of
electron density (figure 2),
which might be in part responsible for some
anomalous radar echoes that have
been reported .compressibility effects in magneto-aerodynamic flows
the effects of compressibility on the steady motion ofhighly
conducting fluid past thin cylindrical bodies in the presence ofmagnetic field are studiedprocedures are developed for the
solution of this class of magnetoaerodynamic problems over the
entire mach number range and for all ratios of magnetic to fluiddynamic
pressurethe results obtained are analogous either to
the ackeret theory or the prandtl-glauert rule of conventional
aerodynamics, depending on the relative values of the flow speed
and the appropriate speed of propagation of magnetoacoustic
disturbancesthe methods used and the physical interpretation
of the solutions obtained vary according to the orientation of the
magnetic field with respect to the flow directionthe results of the theory are explained in terms of the anisotropic
propagation of magnetoacoustic pulses studied previously
by several authors .incompressible wedge flows of an electrically conducting
the purpose of this note is to discuss the two-dimensional
flow of an electrically conducting viscous fluid pastwedge
in the presence ofmagnetic fieldthe governing differential
equations and boundary conditions are given and analyzed .magnetohydrodynamic flow pastsemi-infinite platethe flow of viscous electrically conducting fluid
pastsemi-infinite plate is consideredthe applied
constant magnetic field and the constant oncoming
velocity of the fluid are in the direction parallel
to the platein addition to reynolds number the flow in the
boundary layer depends on two parameters
andthe two simultaneous
ordinary nonlinear differential equations are solved by
the asymptotic method for the cases when
and respectivelythe main results obtained are as followsthe equations
can be solved exactly for andthe perturbation effect from infinity whenis large
depends on, whereas the perturbation effect from
zero whenis small depends onfor large k, including
there is no solution forit is
assumed that the fluid is incompressible with constant
physical properties .onparticular class of similar solutions of the equations
by introducing the similarity concept to the two-dimensional,
incompressible navier-stokes equations and energy equation,particular class of solutions is foundtwo general types of flows
are considered ..  (1) laminar free convection--i.e., flows which
take place due tobody force--and (2) laminar forced convectionfor free convection on vertical plates, similar solutions are
obtained for two different power-law surface temperature variations,
and it is shown that one of these solutions constitutesnew type of boundary problemresults of numerical integrations
of the equations are compared with solutions of the similar
boundary-layer equations for free convection, and it is demonstrated
thatrange of surface temperature variations exists for
which the boundary layer equations are no longer validfor forced convection, it is shown that the use of similarity
transformations provides an alternate method of deriving the
ordinary differential equations for some well-known solutions,
such as couette and stagnation point flowssolutions are obtained
for radial converging or diverging flows between plane
surfaces when the temperatures of the surfaces vary as arbitrary
powers of the distance from the orginresults of numerical
integrations of the ordinary differential equations are presented
for prandtl numbers of 0.01 and 1.0 and for linear surface temperature
variationssome rather surprising results are obtained
for diverging flows when separation occurs and some revealing
comparisons with results from boundary-layer theory are made .approximate design of sharp-cornered supersonic nozzlesa modified parabolic curve appears to be in close proximity to that
obtained by either the method of characteristics or the wave methodthus an attempt has been made to use analytic geometry to determine
approximately the contour oftwo-dimensional, sharp-cornered
supersonic nozzle invery short time .approximations for the thermodynamic and transport properties of high
the thermodynamic and transport properties of high-temperature air are
found in closed form starting from approximate partition functions for
the major components in air and neglecting all minor componentsthe
compressibility, enthalpy, entropy, the specific heats, the speed of
sound, the coefficients of viscosity and of thermal conductivity, and
the prandtl numbers for air are tabulated from 500degree to 15,000degreeoverrange of pressure from 0.0001 to 100 atmospheresthe energy
of air and the mol fractions of the major components of air can be found
 from the tabulated values for compressibility and enthalpyit is
predicted that the prandtl number for fully ionized air, which is in
complete equilibrium, will become small compared to unity, the order of
transparent to heat flux .effect of variable heat recombination on stagnation
earlier studies assume an average heat of formation of atoms
based upon external flow conditionsit is shown that equilibrium
heat transfer decreases by 35 fortypical mach number 24 case
when allowance is made for the proportions of air componentsthe variable recombination energy also results in atom mass fractions
which are realistically less for equilibrium than frozen situations
throughout the cold-wall boundary layer .first-order approach tostrong interaction problem
the present paper concerns with
the strong interaction phenomenon over an
insulated semi-infinite flat plate withsharp
leading edgein particular the main interest
is in the consistent treatment in which the
boundary-layer solution may be joined continuously
with the inviscid solution regarding
flow variables including pressure, normal
velocity, temperature (or streamwise velocity) and densityit is shown that the behavior of the inviscid
solution may be consistent with that of the
boundary-layer solution to at least first-order
approximation that is correct to the order of,
whereis the mach
number of undisturbed flow,the reynolds
number based on the distance from leading
edge and the ratio of specific heatsthen
the first-order boundary-layer problem is
formulated under such an external circumstance
and an attempt is made for arriving at the solutionactual calculations are carried out for both
cases of air and heliumfrom the solution
it is found that the region in which the viscous
effect playssignificant role is ranged over
fromtocertain finite value of n, say n, in
terms of the similarity coordinatein the
corresponding incompressible boundary layerthe numerical results moreover indicate
that the induced pressure is considerably smaller
than the estimate of lees (7) obtained by
his approximate method in which the effect
of the first-order induced pressure on the
boundary layer is ignored and no survey of the
first-order boundary-layer equation is madethe present results are also found to be in
excellent agreement with experimental data
recently obtained in helium flow by erickson (15) .hypersonic strong viscous interaction onflat plate
the present report gives an account of
the development of an approximate
theory to the problem of hypersonic
strong viscous interaction
onflat plate with mass-transfer at the
plate surfacethe disturbance
flow region is divided into inviscid and
viscous flow regionsthe hypersonic
small perturbation theory is applied
to the solution of the inviscid
flow regionthe method of similar solutions
of compressible laminar
boundary layer equations is applied to the
treatment of the viscous flow
regionthe law of surface mass-transfer
for similar solutions is derivedthe pressure and the normal velocity are
matched between the inviscid and
viscous flow solutionsformulas for induced
surface pressure, boundary
layer thickness, skin friction coefficient,
and heat transfer coefficient
are obtainednumerical results and their
significance are discussedfuture improvements are indicated .second approximation to laminar compressible boundary
the first-order solution for the laminar compressible boundary-layer
flow overflat plate at constant wall temperature is giventhe
effect of slip at the wall as well as the interaction between the
boundary-layer flow and the outer stream flow are taken into considerationthe solution is obtained explicitly in terms of the known zero
order, or continuum, solutionno
assumptions regarding the prandtl number
or viscosity-temperature law need be madeit is found that the
first-order solution givesdecrease in heat transfer and, for supersonic
flow, an increase in skin frictionfor subsonic flow there is no
first-order shear effectthe change in heat transfer is due to slip
and the change in friction is due to the interaction of the zero- and
first-order velocities at the outer edge of the boundary layer .an approximate solution of hypersonic laminar boundary
approximate formulae of the displacement thickness and the skin
friction of the hypersonic laminar boundary layer are derived by use of
von karman's integral method, assuming the heat-insulated wall, the
prandtl number of unity and chapman and rubesin's formula for the
variation of viscosity with temperaturethe results obtained are compared
with some exact solutionsbecause of the good agreement, it
seems that these formulae are very usefulthese formulae, together with the tangent-wedge-approximation, are
applied to the viscous flow over
slender bodies withsufficiently sharp
leading edgeas an example, the
pressure distribution overflat plate
is calculated numerically over the
entire region of the surfacecomparison

results as well as experimental
values is made .on the hypersonic viscous flow pastflat plate with
the hypersonic viscous flow pastflat

method in special cases when
suction or injection velocity proportional
to, especially
for the region of strong interaction between
the shock wave and the
boundary layer, wereis the pressure on
the plate andis the distance
measured along the plate from its leading edgeseveral numerical examples are given,
which shows similar effects of
injection to those in the case of incompressible
flow that the injection
makes all the height of the shock wave,
the thickness of the boundary
layer and the pressure on the plate larger
than those in the case of no
injectionon the contrary, in the case of
suction no remarkable change
both in the height of the shock wave and
the pressure on the plate can
be seen and only the velocity profile in
the boundary layer is affected
by the suction .on the motion offlat plate at high speed inviscous
the theory of the steady flow ofviscous compressible fluid
pastflat plate at high mach number due to lees and probstein
is extended bymore complete discussion of the flow in
the inviscid layer between the shock wave and the boundary layerit is shown that similar solutions exist in this layer, analogously
to those found by li and nagamatsu in the boundary layer, and
that the two may be joined to give, allowing one minor assumption,full account of the flowit is shown that the boundarylayer
equations may be reduced to those for an incompressible
fluid and that the von karman-pohlhausen method describes
the flow in it with good accuracythe tangent wedge approximation
for the pressure on the plate, used by lees and his collaborators,
is found to be in deficit
by 10 per cent for airfinally,
it is shown that the theory for weak interaction cannot be extended
further withoutcomplete knowledge of the flow .hypersonic viscous flow overflat plate
in dealing with the steady laminar viscous flow oversemi-infinite flat plate some of the following topics are discussedthe streamline in the boundary layer overleading edge of given thicknessthe rate of growth of the boundary layer in the main stream, and

the method is based on the observation of the divergence that occurs in
the variation of mean static pressure at the trailing edge of an aircraft
wing at the critical stage in the development of boundary-layer
separation when its influence first spreads to the trailing edge and
thereby to the overall flowthe significance of the trailing-edge pressure variations and their
connection with the effects that separation has on the mean and unsteady
 loads is discussed for various types of separationgood prediction
can be obtained from wind-tunnel tests, or warning provided in flight,
for low-speed separations and for shock-induced ones up to the stage at
which the shock wave reaches the trailing edgerelated divergences in
wake width, lift coefficient, or shock position can also be usedpressure measurements at other isolated points often indicate the type
of separationcertain special considerations apply for swept wingsthe various flow changes that are considered are illustrated by
schlieren photographs and described in an appendix .chordwise pressure distributions over several nacatwo-dimensional wind-tunnel

are presented without analysis .on alternative forms for the basic equations of transonic
attention has been called by numerous authors to the
possibility of certain alternative forms for the equations for
transonic flow about thin wingsit is the purpose of this note
to contribute to this discussion and to indicate some reasons for
the selection of one form of these in preference to another more
widely used form .simplified method for determination of the criticalsimplified method has been devised for determination of the
critical height of three-dimensional roughness particles required to
promote premature transition oflaminar boundary layer on models of
airplanes or airplane components inwind tunnel with zero heat transfera single equation is derived which relates the roughness height
toreynolds number based on the roughness height and on local flow
conditions at the height of the roughness, and charts are presented
from which the critical roughness height can be easily obtained for
mach numbers fromto.discussion of the use of these charts is
presented with consideration of various model configurationsthe method has been applied to various types of configurations in
several wind-tunnel investigations conducted by the national advisory
committee for aeronautics at mach numbers up to 4, and in all cases
the calculated roughness height caused premature boundary-layer transition
for the range of test conditions .scale effects at high subsonic and transonic speeds
the major scale effects at high subsonic and transonic
speeds arise from differences between the conditions
under which laminar and turbulent boundary layers separate, and in
how they behave after separationfor turbulent
boundary layers, these conditions and behaviour do not vary greatly
as the reynolds number is changed and in many
examples, it has been shown that they are similar for the turbulent
layers that occur naturally at high reynolds number
and for boundary layers in which transition to turbulent flow is fixed
artificiallythe scale effects arising in wind-tunnel
tests made at low reynolds number may, therefore, often be
minimised by fixing transition to turbulent flow by
introducing an artificial disturbance such as that produced by
excrescences attached to the surfacethe fact that the
effects of separation are often less severe for laminar layers than
for the turbulent layers that are likely to be encountered
at full scale, makes it all the more important to do this whenever
possibleseveral methods which can be used to fix transition are described,
and the results obtained by using them are comparedin general, in experiments in two-dimensional flow, good agreement
is found, and explanations can be advanced for
cases in which discrepancies occurseveral uncertainties and
difficulties that arise in fixing transition are discussed
and illustrated by examplesin particular, special care is needed
in interpreting the results obtained with transition
fixed at very low reynolds numbers (say, less than about=x 10
based on local chord for wings of about 0.1
thickness chord ratio and possibly higher reynolds numbers for thinner
wings)the difficulties of fixing transition satisfactorily are increased
for three-dimensional wings, particularly if they are
swept-back or highly tapered (i.e., small chord and reynolds
number near the tip) and if the tests coverlarge range
of incidence including high incidences for which the flow may
separate from very close to the leading edgeunder
these circumstances, it is frequently necessary to place the
excrescences at different chordwise positions for low and
high angles of incidence, and this is inconvenient in practicemore research is needed before sound recommendations
can be made as to how and where transition should be fixed
on such models, particularly since in routine testing, it is
often not possible to check the effects of transition-fixing fullyin the sections dealing with three-dimensional tests, examples
are given of the spurious results that have been avoided
successfully by fixing transition, of the conditions where even
at low reynolds numbers artificial fixing of transition
may not be necessary to giveturbulent boundary layer ahead
of the shock, and of the conditions under which there
are some doubts whether the methods used for fixing transition
have been satisfactory .the occurrence and development of boundary layer separations at high
this note describes the manner in which the onset of the effects of
boundary-layer separation varies with mach number for two-dimensional
aerofoils, and discusses the influence of section shape as far as it is
knowna brief qualitative description is given of the mechanism
underlying the development of the separated flow and its effects,
followed bydiscussion of some of the ways in which this is likely to
differ for swept-back wings at high speedsfinally, the need is
emphasized for continued work inbroadening field .non-equilibrium flow of an ideal dissociating gasthe theory of an'ideal dissociating'gas developed by lighthill/1957/for

of this region is then computed infew particular casesthe
method used in the latter case is an extension of the'newtonian'theory
of hypersonic inviscid flowin particular, the case ofsphere is
treated in some detailthe variation of the shock shape and the
sphere diameter to the length scale of the dissociation process, is
exhibited for conditions extending from completely undissociated flow
to dissociated flow in thermal equilibriumresults would indicate
that significant and observable changes from the undissociated values
occur, although values for the non-equilibrium parameter are not, at
present, available .inviscid hypersonic flow past blunt bodiestwo methods are shown for the calculation of the flow field

the body and leads to iterations on the initially assumed position
of the shockthe second is an integral method closely analogous
to the karman-pohlhausen procedure for boundary layersa

the purpose of the present note is to give an exact solution of
the incompressible navier-stokes equations at an axisymmetric
stagnation point with vorticity in the oncoming flow which varies
linearly with distance from the axisthis solution has application
to the hypersonic axisymmetric blunt body problem, for which
lighthill has shown the vorticity in the inviscid shock layer is
very nearly of this form .vorticity effect on the stagnation point flow ofviscous incompressible

value at greater than 10,000reviewer's comment is concerned with the perfect gas assumption
for airauthor suggests that the effects of dissociation on
flow properties are accounted for byproper choice of specific
heat ratioa consideration of the kinetics of chemical reaction in
the cooled boundary layer emphasizes the oversimplification of
this approachthe effect on transport properties could have been
approximated in present analysis by changing the prandtl number

.various aerodynamic characteristics in hypersonic rarefied
this paper considers the problem of calculating viscous aerodynamic
characteristics of blunt bodies at hypersonic speeds and
at sufficiently high altitudes where the appropriate mean free
path becomes too large for the use of familiar boundary-layer
theory but not so large that free molecule concepts applyresults of an order-of-magnitude analysis are presented to
define the regimes of rarefied gas flow and the limits of continuum
theorybased on theoretical and experimental evidence,
the complete navier-stokes equations are used asmodel, except /very close/ to the free molecule conditionthis
model may not necessarily give the shock wave structure in
detail but satisfies overall conservation laws and should givereasonably accurate picture of all mean aerodynamic quantitiesin this /intermediate/ regime there are two fundamental classes
of problems ../viscous layer/ class and/merged layer/
class, the latter corresponding tolarger degree of rarefactionfor the viscous layer class there isthin shock wave, but the
shock layer region between the shock and the body is fully viscous,
although the viscous stresses and conductive heat transfer
are small at the shock wave boundaryhere, the use of the
navier-stokes equations with outer boundary conditions given
by the hugoniot relations is justifiedfor the merged layer
class, the shock wave is no longer thin, and the navier-stokes
equations can be used to givesolution which includes the shock
structure and has free-stream conditions as outer boundary conditionsa simpler procedure is presented for /incipient merged/
conditions where the shock may no longer be considered an infinitesimally
thin discontinuity but where it has not thickened
sufficiently to entail the /fully merged layer/ analysisin this
case we approximate the shock bydiscontinuity obeying conservation
laws which include curvature effects, viscous stresses,
and heat conductionforsphere and cylinder it is shown that the navier-stokes
equations can be reduced to ordinary differential equations for
both the viscous and merged layer class of problemssolutions
of these equations, when used in connection with hypersonic flow
problems, are in general only valid in the stagnation regionto
illustrate the viscous layer solutions, numerical calculations
have been performed forsphere and cylinder with the assumption
of constant density in the shock layer, which isuseful
approximation at hypersonic speedsto illustrate the merged
layer solution, calculations have been carried out forsphere
using the incipient merged layer approximationresults are presented for detachment distance, surface shear,
and heat-transfer rate in the stagnation region ofhighly cooled
sphere flying at hypersonic speedwith decreasing reynolds
number, the shear and heat transfer are shown to increase above
the extrapolated boundary-layer values in the viscous layer
regime and then to begin falling in the incipient merged regimeas the reynolds number decreases in the incipient merged
regime, the density in the shock layer increases, and the static
and stagnation enthalpy behind the shock decreasecalculations performed for an insulated sphere show that, with
decreasing reynolds number in the incipient merged regime,
the density in the shock layer decreases,. the total enthalpy behind
the shock and at the stagnation point increase so that they
are higher than the free-stream total enthalpy,. and the stagnation-point
pressure behaves like the total enthalpyfor the highly cooled cylinder in the viscous layer regime, the
same quantities are presented as for the spherethe increase
found in shear and heat transfer above extrapolated boundarylayer
theory is small, in agreement with vorticity interaction
theorya discussion is given of the behavior of available experimental
data for viscous flow quantities in the intermediate regime and
the behavior predicted by the results of the present calculationsqualitative agreement is indicated .taylor instability of finite surface wavesthe instability of the accelerated interface
betweenliquid (methanol or carbon
tetrachloride) and air has been investigated
experimentally for approximate
sinusoidal disturbances of wave-number range
from well below to well above the
cut-offthe growth rates are measured and
compared with theoretical resultsa third-order theory shows the phenomena
of overstability which is found in the
experimental resultssome measurements
of later stages of growth agree
moderately well with the available theory
and disclose some additional phenomena
of bubble competition, helmholtz
instability with transition to turbulence,
and jet instability with production of drops .effects of surface tension and viscosity on taylor
the model used is that of two
fluids of infinite depth, with the interface
initially in the form ofsine wave with
amplitude small compared to wave lengththe fluids are considered incompressible,
and only the linear terms in the equations of
hydrodynamics are usedthe first four
sections discuss the effects of surface tension
and viscositythe fifth givesfew numerical
results to illustrate the main points of
the preceding sections .similitude of hypersonic real-gas flows over slender
on the basis of the hypersonic small-perturbation theory, the
laws of similitude for hypersonic inviscid flow fields over thin or
slender bodies are examined, and the restrictions to ideal gases
with constant specific heats and to bodies with pointed noses are
removedonly steady plane or axisymmetric flows are consideredinspection of the governing system of equations shows thatsimilitude law exists for flow fields, under local thermal equilibrium,
having the same free-stream atmospherefor flows of
ideal gas with constant specific heats, the requirement of the same
free-stream atmosphere--i.e., the same composition, pressure, and
density--can be replaced by the requirement of the same ratio of
specific heatsfor flows over blunted wedges or cones, special laws of similitude
can be obtainedapplication of the similarity rules is examined for the case of
hypersonic flows of an ideal gas with over flat plates
with blunt leading edges, and for the case of equilibrium air
flows over wedgesthe possibility of simulating nonequilibrium
flows over slender or thin bodies is also pointed out .boundary-layer interaction onyawed infinite wing in hypersonic
the equations are given for the laminar boundary-layer
equations onyawed infinite wing for constant
wall temperature, under the combined howorth and
mangler transformationdiagrams show the relatively
small influence of yaw, the increase of boundary-layer
secondary flow, and the variation of the local heat
transfer rate with yaw .influence of the leading-edge shock wave on the laminar boundary layer
in order to bring out the importance of the leading-edge region at
hypersonic speeds, the influence of the leading-edge shock wave on
the laminar boundary layer is investigated in two simple cases of
steady flow oversemi-infinite, insulated flat plate..  (1) sharp
leading edge., (2) blunt leading edge, as approximated bynormal
shock wavethe streamlines that enter the boundary layer overlarge
region of the plate surface has previously crossed the shock wave
very near the leading-edge, where the shock is strong and highly
curvedconsequently, the temperature at the outer edge of the
boundary layer is appreciably higher than free-stream temperature,
and the vorticity there is not zerothe effects of this shock-wave
larger than the usual /errors/ made in the boundary-layer theory,
and an estimate of these effects can therefore be obtained within the
framework of that theorythe numerical magnitude of the shock-wave
influence is found to be appreciablefor the case of the blunt
leading edge the slope of the curve of induced pressures plotted against
the hypersonic interaction parameter closely approaches the experimental
data of hammitt and bogdonoff obtained in helium at large values of this
parameterthese approximate results show that the influence of the
leading-edge region at hypersonic speeds requires careful theoretical
and experimental study .the interaction between boundary layer and shock waves in transonic
experiments of transonic flow pastcircular arc profile show that the
shock-wave pattern and the pressure distribution are strongly dependent
upon the state of the boundary layera change from laminar to
turbulent boundary layer atgiven mach number changes the flow pattern
 considerablyshock waves can interact with the boundary layer inmanner similar toreflection fromfree jet boundarythese shock waves are not
distinctly discernible from pressure distribution measurements .simplified laminar boundary layer calculations for
since the introduction of momentum methods in boundarylayer
calculations by von karman and pohlhausen, many improvements
have been proposedan especially simple solution
reduces the problem toquadraturehere, it is proposed to extend
these methods to elementary three-dimensional cases and to
compressible laminar boundary-layer calculationsfor comparison,
the corresponding problems for the turbulent boundary
layer are also discussed briefly .boundary layer transition with gas injectionthe mass-injection process has been proposed asmethod
of cooling aerodynamic surfaces, and, since the amount of
coolant required to maintain practical wall temperatures is considerably
larger for turbulent than for laminar boundary layers,
knowledge of the effect of the cooling method on the transition
process is certainly importantexploratory studies reported
here were conducted at mach number 3.7 to ascertain the effects
of gas injection on the stability of the laminar boundary
layer onconical surface .mass transfer cooling at mach number 4. 8.
mass-transfer experiments on5 mil wire porous cone
of 20 total angle have been conducted at using
air and helium injectiondetails of the experimental technique
are described in referencesand.  in the laminar boundary
layer the recovery factors and heat-transfer coefficients measured
with zero injection agreed within per cent with theorytransition reynolds numbers observed on the porous cone with
zero injection were half as large as observed onsmooth, impermeable
model of identical geometry in the same channel, but
injection of large amounts of air or helium did not cause transition
to move forward from its zero-injection position on the
porous conedistributed roughness of this type apparently does
not disturb impermeable wall theory, but it masks whatever
effective roughness may be caused by discrete pore injection .experimental evaluation of heat transfer with transpiration
it is found that for prescribed velocity field, electrical field and
conductivity, the current can be calculated by integrationwork is
related to analytic investigation of the boundary layer inphysically
reasonable accelerator .analysis of effects of diffusion offoreign gas into
adiabatic wall temperatures and recovery factors are calculated
for pipe flows with an entrance mach number ofand with uniform
injection of heliumpredicted values of the recovery factor increase
slowly with increasing injection rate and with increasing
distance from the tube entrance .the analytical design of an axially symmetric laval
the equations for the nozzle's contours are derived by integration
of the characteristic equations of the axially symmetric flowsince it is not possible to integrate these equations mathematically
in an exact form, it was necessary to findway to approximate
the calculationsthe approximation offers itself by considering
and comparing the conditions of the flow incone with
those innozzle, aslinearization of the characteristic equationsthe first part of the report deals with equations for the transition
curve by which the conical source flow is converted intoparallel stream of uniform velocitythe equations are derived
by integration alongmach line of the flow in the region where
the conversion takes placea factoris introduced expressingrelation between the direction and the velocity of the flow alongcertain mach linef remains undetermined and is not involved
in the final equationsin the second part of the report, the spherical sonic flow section
is converted intoplane circular section of the throatthe nozzle's contour adjacent to the throat is formed by the arc
ofcircle connected with the transition curve bystraight linethe gas dynamic properties of the boundary mach line are calculated
in table 1, the use of which shortens the calculations considerably
.effect of diffusion fields on the laminar boundarytheory is developed which describes the effect ofgeneral
diffusion field on the dynamic and thermal characteristics oflaminar boundary layer onflat plate in steady compressible
flowfluid properties are considered as functions of temperature
and local concentration of the foreign gasthe diffusion
field is described bydifferential equation that relates convective
and diffusion transfer and which considers diffusion currents
arising from gradients of concentration and temperatureby
means of the usual transformations the system is reduced toset
of ordinary differential equations, which in turn are transformed
intoset of integral equationsthe latter is amenable to solution
by the method of successive approximationsthe theory and results have bearing on the problem of control
and reduction of aerodynamic heating at hypersonic speedsthe special feature of this approach lies in the utilization of diffusion
fields for the purpose of reducing the detrimental effects
of viscous dissipationalthough the theory is adapted tofuller investigation of this problem, the numerical examples
considered involve mainly diffusion fields of helium, with which
good results have been achieved at mach numbersand 12whereas at the higher mach number the influx of heat was practically
eliminated,reversal in the direction of heat flow has
been effected at the lower mach number .transpiration cooling experiments inturbulent boundary
turbulent recovery factor and heat-transfer measurements have been
made onporous flat wall section atnominal mach number of 3.0 andreynolds number of approximatelyx 10 using both air and helium as the
transpired gasmeasured heat-transfer
coefficients correlate well with the
compressible theory of rubesin for air
and qualitatively with simple film
theory for either coolant, indicating that
the heat transfer fromturbulent
boundary layer can be reduced by transpiration
cooling to well below that of
the uncooled boundary layer at the same reynolds number .some experimental techniques in mass transfer coolingauthor introduces his survey bybrief review of the history of
investigations dealing with boundary layers on impermeable solid
surfaces, and notes that no true theory exists for turbulent boundary
layers, the success of studies in this area having been due to
the introduction of artificial, if ingenious, assumptions which permitted
empirical correlations fd datathe terminology introduced
by the author for distinguishing the different situations involving
mass transfer from the wall to the stream may give rise to some
objectionsfor instance, /film cooling/ need not refer only to
the injection ofliquid, since applications involving gas film
cooling existalso, his restriction of the term /transpiration
cooling/ to refer to the injection throughporous surface ofgas
only of the same composition as the exterior stream does not enjoy
universal usagethe influence of mass transfer on heat transfer
through laminar boundary layers and on the transition from laminar
to turbulent flow is described, with consideration given to the
question of the net effect of the stabilizing influence of surface
cooling and the destabilizing influence of injectionreviewer suggests that author's inaccurate statement to the effect
that /thus far the higher energy conditions do not threaten
to involve turbulent injection, so turbulent boundary-layer research
enjoysfairly academic serenity broken only by its own frustrations/
be excused on grounds of poetic license, although it ignores
the efforts being devoted to the pressing practical problems
of erosive burning of solid propellants (possibly the most common
example ofcomplete /aerothermochemical/ problem involving
distributed surface heat and mass transfer with chemical reaction
inflow system) and of effusion cooling of rocket nozzles, both
of which involve turbulent boundary-layer conditionsauthor
emphasizes the tedious experimental problems involved in research
on boundary layers with blowing, and notes the desirability of velocity
distribution measurements, especially in turbulent injection
layersthe observation that no good data on concentration profiles
in the case of the diffusion boundary layer have been published
may be an overstatement, since author's bibliography overlooks

the development of supersonic compressors, supersonic
diffusers, and high-speed aircraft points to the increasing importance
of the interaction between shock waves and boundary
layersthe experimental work reported here is intended to (1) providebetter understanding of the nature of the shock-boundarylayer
interaction, (2) serve asguide and stimulus to theoretical
work, and (3) develop an empirical method for predicting the

shock fromboundary layer onflat surface atmach number
of 2.05the effects of shock strength and boundary-layer regime
were exploredthe results are in the form of schlieren photographs, constantdensity
contours found from interferometer photographs, and
static pressure distributions at the plate surface .measurements of turbulent friction onsmooth flat plate in supersonic
direct measurements of supersonic local skin friction, using the
floating-element technique, are presented for mach numbers from
bulent flow and transition are emphasized, although some measurements
in the laminar regime are includedthe observed effect
of compressibility is to reduce the magnitude of turbulent skin

pressure is verified withinfew per cent by two experimental
methodstypical static pressure measurements are presented to
show that transition can be detected by observing disturbances
in pressure associated with changes in displacement thickness

appendix compares the present measurements at= 2.5 with
experimental data from other sources .boundary layer measurements in hypersonic flowexperimental data are presented on boundary-layer formation,
heat transfer, and skin-friction coefficient at mach numbers of
the wall ofconical nozzle in the presence offavorable pressure
gradient and several rates of heat transferthe reynolds number
based on momentum thickness varied from 1,500 to 3,500comparison is made with data at lower mach numbers and with
the semiempirical theory of von karmanthe existing data up
to mach numbers of nine indicate agreement to withinper
cent when compared withform of the wilson theory, but it is
clear that the effects of heat transfer and pressure gradients present
problems which require extensive study and experiment in
the future .turbulent boundary layer in compressible fluidsthe continuity, momentum, and energy differential equations
for turbulent flow ofcompressible fluid are derived, and the
apparent turbulent stresses and dissipation function are identifieda general formula for skin friction, including heat transfer
toflat plate, is developed forthin turbulent boundary
layer in compressible fluids with zero pressure gradientcurves
are presented giving skin-friction coefficients and heat-transfer
coefficients for air for various wall-to-free-stream temperature
ratios and free-stream mach numbersin the special case when the boundary layer is insulated, this
general formula yields skin-friction coefficients higher than those
given by the von karman wall-property compressible-fluid formula
but lower than those given by the von karman incompressible-fluid
formulaheat transfer from the boundary layer
to the plate generally increases the friction and heat-transfer
coefficients .numerical solution of the boundary layer equations
the crocco transformation combined withmangler transformation
is used to carry the boundary-layer problem for axially
symmetric blunt bodies intoform suitable for direct numerical
computation without introduction of similarity assumptionsconditions which in the original problem appear at infinity now
are brought tofinite straight line, and the body is transformed
toparallel linedata can be generated on the stagnation line
the equations areparabolic system of two second-order equations,
the boundary-value problem is analogous to the slab problem
for the heat equationan implicit difference equation is
used to reduce stability difficultiesspecial techniques in forming
the difference equation result inlinear system of algebraic
equations to be solved on any given line of integration, and these
solutions are computed from recursion relations generated by
back substitutionfor bluntnosed bodies with approach flow
mach numbers greater than(approximately), large temperature
gradients occur acrossthin boundary layer of dissociated

by certain fits to the gas tablesa case is computed, however,
forlower mach number approach flow using perfect-gas theory

tested .laminar jet mixing of two compressible fluids with heat releasethe laminar jet mixing problems with heat release have been formulateda general discussion of the solution of these problems is also giventhe important parameters of these problems are brought outsome
specific cases of the jet mixing problem, such as jet mixing of one
compressible fluid, isothermal jet mixing of two compressible fluids,
and isovel jet mixing of two compressible fluids with heat release, are
discussed in detail.thermal distributions in jeffrey-hamel flows between nonparallel plane
the authors give the exact solution for the thermal distributions for
the steady laminar flow ofviscous incompressible fluid between nonparallel
plane walls held atconstant temperaturethe velocity
profiles are determined with the aid of jacobian elliptic functions by
using the jeffery-hamel solution of the hydrodynamic problemit is
shown that in this special case the energy equation giving the temperature
profiles can be reduced to an ordinary linear differential
equation with variable coefficientsafter the introduction of dimensionless
parameters, numerical solutions are given for diverging and
converging channels with total openings of 10degree for the possible
combinations of three reynolds numbers and five prandtl numbers .on heat transfer oversweat-cooled surface in laminarsimple expression is derived for the normal injection velocity
distribution theoretically required to maintaingiven uniform
temperature alongporous surface in the laminar boundarylayer
region ofcompressible flow withgiven velocity distribution
outside of the boundary layerthis expression is valid for
any given free-stream mach number but is based onprandtl
number of unity and on the assumption that the viscosity coefficient
varies linearly with the temperatureby using the
dorodnitsyn type of transformation, the variation of fluid properties
even in the case of zero mach number is taken into accountthis study is of particular practical interest in connection
with the sweat-cooling of turbine blades and of airfoil surfaces
in high speed flowthe method of analysis consists of applying
the karman-pohlhausen method to both the momentum and
energy boundary-layer equations and of using an additional heat
balance equation, involving the coolant temperaturea closedform
approximate solution of the equations is then derivednumerical
examples for flow in the immediate vicinity ofstagnation
point and fortypical type of flow overturbine blade are
given .the effect of helium injection at an axially symmetric stagnation
an effective means of protecting the surface ofhypersonic re-entry
vehicle is to inject small quantities oflightweight gas into the
boundary layer throughporous wallthis process, which is known
as mass-transfer cooling, protects the surface in two waysfirst
of all, as the injected gas or coolant passes from the reservoir through
the wall to the surface,considerable quantity of heat is absorbed as
its temperature is raised from the reservoir temperature to the wall
surface temperaturecharacteristically, lightweight gases have
relatively high specific heatssecondly, the transfer of mass and enthalpy by convection and diffusion
normal to the surface alters the characteristics of the boundary
layer in suchmanner as to reduce the temperature gradient at the
wall, and, hence, the conductive heat transfer at the wallthis is
sometimes referred to as the blowing effect .laminar heat-transfer and pressure measurements over blunt-nosed
tests have been conducted atmach number of 6, in the pibal hypersonic
facility, in order to determine the heat-transfer and pressure
distributions overslender blunted cone at angles of attack of
erature ratio, stagnation to wall, was approximately 2.3the model
tested hassperical nose diameter of 1.0 in.,base diameter of 3.75
in., andcone half-angle of 20 degreesthe measurements were made
atperipheral stations on the modelin this note the experimental results at15 degree angle of attack
are presenteda more detailed analysis of the results for all
angles of attack is presented in reference.the injection of air into the dissociated hypersonic laminar boundary
in first approximation, dissociated air may be treated asbinary
mixture of air atoms and air moleculesin order to include the
effects of mass transfer into the boundary layer, it becomes necessary
to introducethird chemical species and hencesecond diffusion
equationwe have avoided this complexity by considering the injection
of air molecules into the boundary layer, and hence the theoretical
treatment is accomplished within the framework ofbinary mixture gas .on optimum nose curves for missiles in the super-aerodynamic
author shows that the differential equations defining the minimum
drag body shapes for free molecule flow that were developed
and numerically integrated by w. j. carter (amr 11 (1958), rev.
realized, however, that numerical or analytical integration of the
second-order differential equation is unnecessary since, for the
flow conditions considered, the first integral to the euler equation
can be written prior to the substitution of the expression defining
the pressure coefficient .optimum nose shapes for missiles in the super-aerodynamic
the mechanics of the kinetic theory of gases is employed to
describe the drag force on the nose ofmissile moving in the superaerodynamic
region of the atmospherethree separate cases are
considered--ideal specular reflection, specular-type reflection
fromslightly rough surface, and surface absorption followed by
random emission of the striking moleculesthe calculus of variations
is employed to obtain the differential equation of the nose
shape which minimizes the drag force for each of the three casesthe resulting differential equations are then solved bynumerical
procedurethe drag coefficients for the optimum nose shapes are
likewise determined and these are compared with the drag coefficients
given by other nose shapesit is further shown that
the drag coefficients arising when specular-type reflections occur
are significantly dependent on the nose shapewhen surface
absorption followed by random emission occurs, the drag coefficient
is not strongly dependent on either the missile nose shape
or the fineness ratio of the nose .on the model of the free shock separation, turbulent
by free shock-separated boundary layers, one means that type of separation
where the flow downstream of the separation region is free to
adjust to any direction that may result from the shock-boundary-layer
interaction processa detailed model of the free shock-separated turbulent
boundary layer is postulated, and the pressure rise following
from this model is estimated and compared with experimentsthe results
are applied to the prediction of separation in an overexpanded
nozzle .note on the hypersonic similarity law for an unyawed
it is now known that the hypersonic similarity law derived for
slender cones and ogival bodies under the assumption, is
applicable for mach numbers as low as.  this note makes use ofseries development to infer the hypersonic similarity law for unyawed
cones from the taylor-maccoll differential equations and
associated boundary conditionsa simple approximate formula
for the function of the similarity law is obtained,
and the drag function computed with this formula is compared
with kopal's numerical results and, for very slender cones, with
von karman's linearized formula .lift on inclined bodies of revolution in hypersonic flowthe importance of body lift lies in the fact that at moderate angles of
attack and high mach number it can constitute an appreciable part of
the total lift ofwinged missilein this paper an attempt has been
made to analyze body lift in hypersonic flow by an approximate method
and, together withcorrelation of existing experimental data, to
indicate the probable variation of body lift overwide range of mach
numbers extending from low supersonic to hypersonicthe method of
analysis of hypersonic flow over inclined bodies of revolution employed
herein has been denoted as the hypersonic approximationit is an improvement
on the newtonian corpuscular theory of aerodynamics, since it
considers the centrifugal forces resulting from the curved paths of the
air particles in addition to the impact /newtonian/ forces .the flow ofviscous liquid pastflat plate at small
the authors repeat the earlier calculations of piercy
and winny (proc. roy. soc. london. ser. a. 140 (1933),
earlier works were known to be different from each otherthe careful analysis of the present authors shows that the
skin-friction coefficient up to the second approximation
agrees perfectly with that of piercy and winny .three-dimensional effect of flutter inreal fluidin ref. 1, an alternative semi-empirical formulation for flutter inreal fluid is givenfor more accurate determination of the empirical
coefficients, the three-dimensional effect of finite span should be
taken into accountfollowing reissner's approximation for largeaspect-ratio
rectangular wings, the boundary-value problem governing the
downwashand the vorticity distribution .an alternative formulation of the problem of flutter
it is well known, in steady flow, that the actual lift curve
slope is somewhat less than that predicted by inviscid flow
theory, even at small angles of attackas the stall angle is approached,
the lift curve slope continually decreases and thus deviates
even more from the theoretical valuepinkerton employed
the measured circulation to determine the pressure distribution
and found that the resulting prediction of the moment
is considerably improved over that given by the classical theorythis amounts to replacing the conventional kutta-joukowski
condition with the condition that the total lift should agree with
the measured value, and this, in turn, completely determines the
flow patternpractically, this is accomplished by givingfictitious camber to the profilesince potential flow theory is
valid outside of the boundary layer, once the boundary-layer
thickness is known, the potential flow may be corrected for the
displacement thickness and the viscous wake by appropriate
source distributionsthe boundary layer cannot be evaluated,
of course, until the potential flow is known and the circulation is
applieda criterion to determine the circulation, by generalizing
the kutta-joukowski condition, was proposed by preston
and spence by assuming that the pressure at the trailing edge
shall have the same value when determined from the potentialflow
values above and below the airfoilthis procedure gives
qualitative information concerning viscous effects in steady
flow .a method for analysing the insulating properties of
in some cooling problems associated with high energy flows
it may be convenient to localize strongly the cooling, as for example
by injectingcoolant through an upstream porous strip,
and to depend on the insulating properties of the boundary layer
to reduce, or to eliminate completely the need for further cooling
on the surface downstream of the highly cooled sectionthis
upstream cooling technique may be of interest in connection with
optical windows in hypersonic wind tunnels, and on radomes,
wings, and bodies of high-speed aircraft and missilesin this papermethod for investigating the insulating properties
oflaminar compressible boundary layer ontwo-dimensional
surface with zero heat transfer is presentedthe physical
situation considered thus corresponds to the case in which the
heat transfer downstream of the strongly cooled section is completely
eliminatedof practical concern is how the temperature
of the uncooled surface varies in the downstream direction
from its low initial value and thus how the low energy layer
established by the upstream cooling insulates the downstream
surfacethe karman integral method extended to both the momentum
and energy partial differential equations of the boundary layer
has been usedthe station, at which cooling and or injection
ceases, corresponds todiscontinuity in boundary conditions
and thus in solutionsat this point the flux of mass, momentum,
and energy within the boundary layer has been made continuous
by the introduction of three additional parameters in the velocity
and stagnation enthalpy profilesthus the velocity and stagnation
enthalpy profiles have both been taken as sixth degree
polynomialsthe resulting two integral-differential equations
are then solved for two unknown functions of the distance along
the wallthese two functions are related to the boundary-layer
thickness and to the wall temperatureinitial conditions corresponding
togiven initial wall temperature and an initial boundary-layer
thickness are prescribedexact closed-form solutions
for the case of zero axial pressure gradient are obtainedfor
flows with significant pressure gradients, numerical solutions
are required in generalseveral numerical examples of practical
interest are presented .the homogeneous boundary layer at an axisymmetric stagnation
this report presentstheoretical analysis of the boundary
layer at an axisymmetric stagnation point with large rates of
air injectionthe results ofprevious investigation indicated
that for localized mass transfer in the stagnation region, the
rates of injection are considerably greater than those usually
treatedthe exact stagnation-point boundary-layer equations
are integrated numerically for an approximate representation
of the gas propertiesthe two-point boundary conditions are
treated innew manner which is useful for various boundarylayer
and mixing problemsthe exact solutions indicate that
for large rates of injection the boundary layer is closely represented
by an inner isothermal shear flow and by and exterior,
relatively thin region, in which the flow variables change to their
free-stream valuesan integral method based on profiles
suggested by the exact solutions is developed and shown to lead
to accurate predictions of the integral thicknesses which are
of interest forstudy of the downstream influence of the stagnation-point
mass transfer .helium injection into the boundary layer at an axisymmetric
this report presentstheoretical analysis of the boundary
layer at an axisymmetric stagnation point with large rates of
helium injectionthe exact stagnation-point boundary-layer
equations are integrated numerically with approximate representations
of the gas propertiesthe treatment of the twopoint
boundary-value problem employed herein is shown to be
useful for various boundary-layer and mixing problemsthe
exact solutions indicate that for large rates of injection the
boundary layer can be represented bythick, inner layer of
constant shear, temperature, and composition and byrelatively
thin outer region in which the flow variables adjust to their freestream
valuesan inviscid-flow model is shown to lead to accurate
predictions of this shear layer and will thus provide sufficiently
accurate profiles for use in the study of the downstream
influence of stagnation-point mass transferthe heat transfer
to the stagnation point is also consideredtabulations of the
eigenvalues forvariety of wall conditions and injection rates

is carried out by rotations about roll and pitch axes,
that is, in the manner ofconventional aeroplanethis
paper discusses some problems in the application of this
form of control to homing missilesin comparison with the alternative cartesian configuration,
this method presents some special design
problemsin the former case, it is often possible to
resolve the motion into two planes and consider the
pitch and yaw control systems as independent twodimensional
problemsthis simplification is not possible
in the case of polar control and it is usually
necessary to consider the whole three-dimensional systemthe equations of motion which result are, in
general, not susceptible to analysisbecause of this,
the design of control systems requires extensive use of
simulators .an approximate solution of the supersonic blunt body
the integral method of belotserkovskii has been carried out to
the first approximation for arbitrary blunt axisymmetric bodies
in supersonic or hypersonic flightthis method is direct, in
that it gives the surface-pressure distribution and shock shape forprescribed bodyresults obtained by numerical integration
for several body shapes at several mach numbers are compared
to experimental results with good agreementit is also shown
that the method can be successfully applied to pointed bodies
with attached shockin the stagnation region, simple relationships
are found from the equations of the first approximation
which connect the surface-velocity gradient, shock curvature,
shock-detachment distance, and body curvaturethese relations
are also correlated with experiment forvariety of shapes
asfunction of mach numberthe correlations permitrapid
estimate of the stagnation-point velocity gradient, important for
heat-transfer calculations, for any blunt body from the shock
stand-off distancea method forhigher approximation is described,
for which, in contrast to the higher approximations of
belotserkovskii,large number of simultaneous total differential
equations with unknown parameters does not occurone form
of this method has been studied numericallyresults are given
which, though only partially successful, indicate the amount of
improvement to be expected fromhigher approximation .theoretical pressure distribution onhemisphere-cylinder
in recent years great use has been made of approximate methods for
the determination of the pressure distribution on blunt-nosed bodies
and afterbodies at high mach numbersfor quasi-spherical bodies
it has been suggested that modified newtonian theory in combination
withprandtl-meyer expansion be used on the nose portion, the two
laws being matched at the point where the pressure gradients are equalno simple approximation, however, has been found for flat-nosed bodiesas for the pressure distribution on the afterbody, the blast-wave
analogy has been suggested for general nose shapes but particular
afterbody profilesthe purpose of the present note is to compare these approximate
estimates withmore accurate determination of the flow field abouthemisphere-cylinder in an ideal gas flowit was felt that since
experimental investigations in air at this mach number are scarce
and very difficult to obtain, the comparison would be of interestthe
basis of comparison is the flow field as it results fromnumerical
integration of the exact equations governing the motion of the ideal
fluid .note on tip-bluntness effects in the supersonic and
inrecent letter, m. h. bertram presents some data on
flows at= 6.85 around 10 half-angle cones with blunted
tipssince the demarcation between the supersonic and hypersonic
regimes is not sharp and since one expects hypersonic flows
to be generally similar to those at lower mach numbers--especially
where viscous effects do not predominate throughout the
entire field of interest--it is of some value to compare bertram's
results with those obtained by giese and bergdolt for 15 halfangle
cones at= 2.45following the observation by charters
and stein that drag coefficient measurements on blunted cones
implyreynolds number effect, giese and bergdolt study the
convergence to conical flow of the perturbed flow aboutcone
with truncated tipthey employ the mach-zehnder interferometer
and the conical flow criterion as analytical tools .an experimental investigation of flow about simple
an experimental investigation was
conducted in the galcit hypersonic
wind tunnel to determine flow characteristics
forseries of blunt bodies atnominal mach number of 5.8 and free-stream
reynolds numbers per in. of
measured values for the pressure
coefficient distributions are compared withmodified newtonian expressionthe agreement is very good for the
three-dimensional bodies and is
fair for the circular cylinder transverse to the
free-stream flow directiona
complete report of the investigation is given ingalcit hypersonic wind
tunnel memorandum .the generalized expansion method and its application
it is demonstrated that the shock-expansion method can be
generalized to treatlarge class of hypersonic flows, only one of
which is flow about airfoilsthis generalized method predicts
the whole flow field, including shock-wave curvatures and resulting
vorticity, providing that (1) disturbances originating on
the surface of an object are largely absorbed in shock waves with
which they interact and (2) disturbances associated with the
divergence of stream lines in tangent planes to the surface are of
secondary importance compared to those associated with the
curvature of stream lines in planes normal to the surfaceit is
shown that these conditions may be met in three-dimensional as
well as two-dimensional hypersonic flowswhen they are met,
surface streamlines may be taken as geodesics, which, in turn,
may be related to the geometry of the surfacethe validity of the generalized shock-expansion method for
three-dimensional hypersonic flows is checked by comparing predictions
of theory with experiment for the surface pressures and
bow shock waves of bodies of revolutionthe bodies treated
are two ogives having fineness ratios ofand.  tests were conducted
at mach numbers from 2.7 to 6.3 and angles of attack up
to 15 degrees in the 10- by 14-in. supersonic wind tunnel of the
ames aeronautical laboratoryat the lower angles of attack,
theory and experiment approach agreement when the ratio of
mach number to fineness ratio--that is, the hypersonic similarity
parameter--exceeds.  at the larger angles of attack, theory
tends to break down, as would be expected, on the leeward sides
of the bodiesasfinal point, it is inquired if the two-dimensionality of
inviscid hypersonic flows has any counterpart in hypersonic
boundary-layer flowsthe question is answered in the affirmative,
and results of experiment are employed to providepartial
check of this conclusion .an investigation of optimum zoom climb techniquesthe problem of optimal zoom climb maneuvering ofturbojet
aircraft has been investigated using the mayer formulation of the
calculus of variationsthe euler-lagrange equations governing
optimum symmetric flight have been integrated numerically by
digital computationdiscontinuities in thrust arising from turbojet afterburner
blowout have been treated, and conditions which must be satisfied
across the interface generated by the discontinuity have been
derivedarbitrary control techniques have been compared with the
optimum, and it has been found that performance is relatively
insensitive to piloting technique unlesstime limitation is imposed
which requires high maneuvering load factors .steady flow in the laminar boundary layer ofgasif the boundary-layer equations forgas are
transformed by mises's transformation, as
was done by karmantsion for the flow
alongflat plate ofgas with unit prandtl
number, the computation of solutions is
simplified, and use may be made of previously
computed solutions for an incompressible fluidfor any value of the prandtl number, and
any variation of the viscosity with the temperature
t, after the method has been applied
to flow alongflat plate (a problem otherwise treated
by crocco), the flow near the forward
stagnation point ofcylinder is calculated with
dissipation neglected, both with the effect of
gravity on the flow neglected and with this effect
retained for vertical flow pasthorizontal
cylinderthe approximations involved by the neglect
of gravity are considered generally,
and the cross-drift is calculated whenhorizontal
stream flows pastvertical surfacewhen, and the boundary is heat-insulated,
it is shown that the boundary-layer
equations forgas may be made identical, whatever be
the main stream, with the boundarylayer
equations for an incompressible fluid withcertain,
determinable, main streamthe
method is also applied to free convection atflat plate
variation with altitude of the state of the surrounding
fluid neglected) and to laminar flow in
plane wakes, but for plane jets the conditions,
previously imposed by howarth,
are also imposed here in order to obtain simple solutions .transformation between compressible and incompressible
it is proposed to show that the boundary-layer equation of
compressible flow can be reduced to that of incompressible
flowsuch work was initiated by stewartson and by rott and
crabtreein the following some of the restrictions imposed by
referencesandwill be removed, and it will be shown that the
transformation from compressible boundary layer to incompressible
boundary layer can be applied to the laminar, as well as
turbulent, casea direct method will be used for this purpose .a turbulent analog of the stewartson-illingworth transformationthe stewartson-illingworth transformation is applied to the
integral momentum equation for compressible boundary-layer
flow, leaving the x-coordinate transformation unspecified, howeverit is shown that the transformed equation is the integral
momentum equation for incompressible flow if (a) the effect of
compressibility on the boundary-layer shape parametercan be
represented by
and (b) the x-coordinate transformation is chosen to be suitably
related to the ratio of skin-friction coefficients in compressible
and incompressible flowsexperimental evidence is presented which shows that condition
(a) is satisfied for turbulent boundary layers up to=.
an x-transformation is chosen according to (b) and an equation is
presented which gives the turbulent boundary-layer growth in
compressible flow in terms ofsimple quadraturethe predictions
of this equation are then compared with some measurements
on wind-tunnel nozzles .engineering relations for friction and heat transfer to surfaces in high

recently insurvey of heat transfer in whichrelationship for the
reference temperature was developeda calculation procedure for
laminar and turbulent boundary layers, based on this relationship, is
given .reverse flow and variational theorems for lifting surfacesreverse-flow theorem for compressible nonsteady flow, valid
within the limits of linearized theory, is derivedthis theorem
givesgeneral class of relations between linearized solutions for
lifting surfaces in direct and reverse flowbased on the same considerations
used to establish the theorem, an adjoint variational
principle, which may be useful in approximate solutions of nonsteady
lifting surface problems, is obtainedto illustrate the
uses of the reverse-flow theorem, it is applied to the determination
of relations between aerodynamic coefficients in direct and reverse
flow and to the obtaining of influence functions for total
lift, pitching moment, and rolling moment forwing oscillating
with arbitrary motion and surface deformation, in terms of the
pressure distributions for simpler cases in reverse flow .effect of quasi-steady air forces on incompressible
explicit solutions are obtained for the bending-torsion flutter
oftwo-dimensional airfoil in incompressible flow under the
assumptions that the theodorsen function, c(k) is set equal toreal constant, and the diagonal virtual mass terms are negligiblefor the case of small bending to torsion frequency ratio,comparison is made of these quasi-steady solutions with an
earlier empirical expression suggested by theodorsen and garrick
for the nonsteady case, and the effect of the c(k) function is
indicatedthe importance of the c.g. location for these small
cases is re-emphasized, and the possibility of flutter at zero
air speed is indicated .the axisymmetric boundary layer onlong thin cylinderthe laminar boundary layer in axial flow aboutlong thin cylinder is investigated by two
methodsone (2) ispohlhausen method,
based onvelocity profile chosen to represent
conditions near the surface as accurately as
possiblethe other (3) is an asymptotic series
solution, valid far enough downstream from
the nose for the boundary-layer thickness to
have become large compared with the cylinder
radiusanother series solution (due to seban,
bond and kelly) is known, valid near enough
to the nose for the boundary layer to be thin
compared with the cylinder radiusthe
pohlhausen solution shows good agreement with
both series, near and far from the nose, and
enables an interpolation to be made (4) between
them in the extensive range of distances from
the nose for which neither is applicablethe
final recommended curves, for the variation
along the cylinder of skin friction, boundarylayer
displacement area and momentum defect
area, are displayed in graphical and tabular
form (figureand table 1) and are expected to
be correct to within about.the velocity near the wall is closely proportional
to the logarithm of the distance from the
axis,. this is the profile used in the pohlhausen
methodthe analogy with the distribution
of mean velocity in turbulent flow overflat
plate is discussed at the end of.a note on the laminar boundary layer oncircular cylinder incorrection is made for the equation to compute the ratio
of the displacement thickness oncylinder to the corresponding
thickness onflat plate .integration of the boundary layer equations forplane in compressible
the equations of motion of compressible viscous flow with vanishing
pressure gradient pastplane are integrated in semi-convergent
expressions, for the case when the physical constants depend on temperature
and the prandtl number is close to unitysimple expressions are obtained for the temperature and velocity distributions
in the boundary layer, the drag coefficient, and their dependence
on the physical constants,.they contain the well-known results
and several new onesfor the case when the temperature of the boundary is either above, or
not much below, the temperature of the main flow, the results obtained
closely agree with crocco's numerical computations .application of second-order shock-expansion theory
second-order shock-expansion theory is utilized to obtain equations
for the initial normal force curve slope, initial pitching moment curve
slope, and zero-lift wave drag for several type bodies of revolutionbodies considered are the cone-cylinder, cone-cylinder-frustum, conecylinder-frustum-booster,
cone-frustum, and cone-frustum booster .ongeneralised porous-wall ?couette type? flowinrecent paper, the problem of/couette-type/ flow in
which the fixed wall is porous has been consideredthe
results quoted in the above reference can be obtained rigorously
by the method stated below in whichdifferent interpretation to
one of the parameters is made .a generalised porous-wall ?couette type? flowrecently, it was observed that the two existing boundarylayer
texts (referencesand 2) did not containsolution
for the case of couette flow withconstant, uniformly distributed
suction or blowingthus, the following analysis considers/couette-type/ flow betweenstationary flat surface andslightly inclined flat plate moving atconstant velocityin
addition, the flow is subjected toconstant, uniformly distributed
suction or blowing at the fixed surface .heat transfer for laminar flow in an annulus with porous
temperature profiles and heat-transfer rates of established incompressible
flow through an annulus channel with porous walls
of constant temperatures are determined at different injection ratesaxial conduction and viscous dissipation are, as usual, neglectedinjecting fluid is tacitly assumed to have the same temperature as
the porous wall .the pressure gradient induced by shear flow pastarticle iscontinuation of an earlier note on papers by li
onsemiinfinite plate inuniform shear flowli had deduced
from the form of his equations that stream vorticity caused an induced
pressure gradient in the flowlater papers by li and murray
(amr 15(1962), rev. 7157) support the induced pressure gradient
theorythe author notes, however, that the mathematics used
by li and murray are not acceptable and the problem thus not resolvedthe present note sets up simple models of complete flows
examinable by elementary meansauthor holds that analyses
demonstrate conclusively that no pressure gradient is induced in
the boundary layer onflat plate inlimited region of shear flowhe notes that the original question in the case of unbounded shear
remains obscure--and anyway an unlimited shear layer is not of
great practical importance .simple shear flow pastflat plate incompressible
by transformation of variables, the problem ofsimple shear flow ofcompressible fluid overflat plate is reduced to the corresponding
problem for an incompressible fluidthe prandtl number of the compressible
fluid is assumed to be unity and its viscosity to belinear
function of temperature .some panel-flutter studies using piston theorythe use of piston theory was recently advocated for supersonic
aeroelastic analyses, including the problem of panel flutter,
and this has stimulated the investigation reported herelinear piston theory is mainly considered, but some effects of
introducing higher order terms are discussedflutter of rectangular simply supported panels and of elliptically
shaped clamped-edge panels is considered, and some justification
is provided for the use of /static/ aerodynamic forces
and the neglect of aerodynamic dampinghence, it is concluded
that ackeret loading gives more exact results than piston theorysolution of the flutter equations is made by applying galerkin's
method torayleigh-type analysis using assumed modes of
deformation .flutter of rectangular simply supported panels at high
the problem of panel flutter of rectangular simply supported
plates subjected to supersonic flow over one surface is treated
theoreticallythe assumption is made, and subsequently verified,
that the /static/ approximation to the aerodynamic flutter
forces yields flutter boundaries with satisfactory accuracy for
mach numbers greater than about.  two panel flutter analyses
are performed using this static approximation in conjunction with
thin-plate theory--one employs aerodynamic strip theory, the
other aerodynamic surface theorythe influence of mach
number, dynamic pressure, panel aspect ratio, and midplane
stress on the panel thickness required to prevent flutter is determined
for extensive ranges of these parameters .natural frequencies of rectangular plates with edges
plates with attachments to heavier members along the
edges can be described as having edges elastically restrained
against rotation, in many cases uniformly along each edgeat
the edges, setting slope, when is the edge bending
moment with always positive, the elastic restraint can be analytically
defined with describing respectively,
clamped and simply supported edgesin this note natural frequencies
of such plates are calculated mainly following the
nomenclature of dana young .the shear flow alongflat plate with uniform suctionrecently, several authors have investigated the boundary
layer inshear flowin this note, an exact solution of the
navier-stokes equations will be presented, which represents the
boundary layer along an infinite flat plate with uniform suction
situated inshear flow .the viscous flow nearstagnation point when the external flow has
in view of the recent controversy between li and glauert on the nature
of the solution of the boundary-layer equations when the external
flow is rotational, it seems worthwhile to draw attention tocertain
exact solution of the navier-stokes equations which lends support to
glauert's point of view .new methods in heat flow analysis with application
new methods are presented for the analysis of transient heat
flow in complex structures, leading to drastic simplifications in
the calculation and the possibility of including nonlinear and surface
effectsthese methods are in partdirect application of
some general variational principles developed earlier for linear
thermodynamicsthey are further developed in the particular
case of purely thermal problems to include surface and
boundary-layer heat transfer, nonlinear systems with temperature-dependent
parameters, and radiationthe concepts of
thermal potential, dissipation function, and generalized thermal
force are introduced, leading to ordinary differential equations
of the lagrangian type for the thermal flow fieldbecause of the
particular nature of heat flow phenomena, compared with dynamics,
suitable procedures must be developed in order to formulate
each problem in the simplest waythis is done by treatingnumber of examplesthe concepts of penetration depth and
transit time are introduced and discussed in connection with onedimensional
flowapplication of the general method to the
heating ofslab, with temperature-dependent heat capacity,
showssubstantial difference between the heating and cooling
processesan example of heat flow analysis ofsupersonic wing
structure by the present method is also given and requires only
extremely simple calculationsthe results are found to be in
good agreement with those obtained by the classical and much
more elaborate procedures .variational and lagrangian thermodynamics of thermal
extension of previous analyses, indicating the possibility of
extending the thermodynamics of irreversible processes to systems
which are not in the vicinity of an equilibrium state and for which
onsager's relations are not verifiedthis involves generalizations
beyond the narrow field of heat transfer and to principles of wider
range than those of current nonequilibrium thermodynamics .a sublayer for fluid injection into the incompressiblesublayer region is introduced in which the intensity of turbulence
grows atprescribed ratethe decrease in wall shear
stress due to fluid injection into the boundary layer is found under
the hypothesis that the effect of injection is restricted to the
sublayer regionexperimental measurements of the velocity
profiles with fluid injection substantiate this hypothesisthe
theoretical decrease in wall shear stress is in good agreement
with experiment,. the solution is particularly simple and for small
values of the injection parameter it contains no arbitrary parametersthe theory providessimilarity parameter which differs
from the one in general use .heat transfer in turbulent shear flowthe problems of heat transfer in turbulent shear flow alongsmooth wall are discussed from the point of view of von karman's
well-known 1939 paper on the analogy between fluid friction and
heat transfermethods for extending the analysis to higher
prandtl numbers are suggested .conduction of heat in composite slabsa method of calculating the total quantity of heat that passes throughunit area from zero time to timeis developedallowance is made for
 surface resistance by regarding each contact resistance as an additional
layer of the appropriate thermal resistance and zero heat
capacitybuckling stress of clamped rectangular plates in shearby consideration of antisymmetrical, as well as symmetrical,
buckling configurations, the theoretical shear buckling stresses of
clamped rectangular flat plates are evaluated more correctly than in
previous workthe results given, which represent the average of upper
and lower-limit solutions obtained by the lagrangian multiplier method,
are within percent of the true buckling stresses .inviscid hypersonic airflows with coupled non-equilibrium
analyses have been made of the effects of coupled chemical rate
processes in external inviscid hypersonic airflows at high enthalpy
levelsexact (numerical) solutions have been obtained by the
inverse method for inviscid airflow overnear-spherical nose
under flight conditions where substantial nonequilibrium prevails
through the nose regiontypical conditions considered include
nose radii of the order offt at an altitude of 250,000 ft and
velocities of 15,000 and 23,000 ft per secthe results illustrate the general importance of the coupling
among the reactions consideredthese included dissociationrecombination,
bimolecular-exchange, and ionization reactionsthe exact solutions show the bimolecular, no exchange reactions
to be important in blunt-nose flow for the kinetics of no and n,
as they are in the case ofplane shock wavean important
difference between blunt-nose flow and plane shock flow, however,
is the gasdynamic expansion in the curved shock layer of the
formerthis expansion reduces post-shock reaction ratesasconsequence, in the regime studied the oxygen and nitrogen-atom
concentrations tend to freeze in the nose region at levels below
those for infinite-rate equilibriumthe reduction below the
equilibrium dissociation level can be large, particularly for
nitrogen dissociation at higher velocitiesin the regime considered, the chemical kinetics are dominated
by two-body collision processesthe inviscid nose flow, including
coupled nonequilibrium phenomena, is thus amenable to
binary scaling forgiven velocitythe binary scaling is demonstrated
forrange of altitude and scale by correlation of the
exact solutions for given velocity andconstant product of
ambient density and nose radiusthis similitude, which can
also scale viscous nonequilibrium and radiation phenomena in the
shock layer, providesuseful flexibility for hypersonic testing
where it is applicablethe afterbody inviscid-flow problem is briefly discussed in the
light of the results for the nose flow .magnetohydrodynamics shocksa mathematical treatment of the coupled motion of
hydrodynamic flow and electromagnetic fields is
giventwo simplifying assumptions are introduced ..  first,
the conductivity of the medium is infinite, and
second, the motion is described byplane shock wavevarious orientations of the plane of the shock and
the magnetic field are discussed separately, and the
extreme relativistic and unrelativistic behavior is
examinedspecial consideration is given to the behavior
of weak shocks, that is, of sound wavesit is
interesting to note that the waves degenerate into common
sound waves and into common electromagnetic
waves in the extreme cases of very weak and very strong
magnetic fields .magnetohydrodynamic shock wavesan interpretation of the de hoffman-teller shock-wave
equations for an infinitely conducting
medium is given analogous to the classical interpretation of
the ordinary hydrodynamic shock-wave
equations of rankine and hugoniottwo cases of interest
are considered asconsequence of this theoryit is shown that weak magnetic fields in interstellar clouds
will be amplified, and, if external mechanisms
are available to reduce the compressional effects of shock
waves, the field will reachvalue,
whereis the pressurealso, some aspects of the internal
motions of prominences are considered ,. it is
shown that gauss will yield results in accord with
the observational material .two dimensional transonic flow past airfoilsthis report concerns the problem of constructing solutions for
transonic flows over symmetric airfoilsthe aspect of the problem
emphasized is, of necessity, not how to formsolution for compressible
flow but how to simplify the initial phase of the problem, namely, the
mapping of the incompressible flowin the case of the symmetric
joukowski airfoil without circulation, the mapping is relatively simple,
but the coefficients in the power series are difficult to evaluateasresult, the problem requires simplificationinstead of the exact
incompressible flow past the airfoil, an approximate flow is used, which
is derived fromcombination of source and sinkthis flow differs
only slightly from the exact one when the thickness is smallby the
same method, the flow with circulation is also consideredafter the incompressible-flow functions are approximated in this
fashion, the numerical calculation of the corresponding compressible
flow, by the hodograph theory, does not present any
essential difficulty .tables of thermal properties of gasestables of thermodynamic and transport properties
of air, argon, carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, hydrogen,
nitrogen, oxygen, and steam .on the behaviour of boundary layers at supersonic speedsthis paper considers the implications of recent advances in knowledge of
 the behaviour of boundary layers in supersonic flowonly the simplest
 case is considered-dashthat of the two-dimensional boundary layer onflat plate, with nominal zero longitudinal pressure and temperature
gradientsit is shown that the empirical/intermediate enthalpy/used with success
in approximations for skin friction, etc., of laminar boundary layers is
closely the same as the mean enthalpy with respect to velocityfurthermore, the mean enthalpics of laminar and turbulent boundary
layers may be the samea nonrigorous approach is made to the problems
of self-induced pressure gradients, and the indications are that their
effects on laminar skin friction, etc., may become noticeable at mach
numbers greater thanand they increase as the surface temperature
builds up towards zero heat-transfer conditionsthe effects with
turbulent boundary layers may not be so severefinally, the results are applied to give an idea of the magnitude of the
drag and aerodynamic heating problems up to10, and one result is
that, if there is any conflict at the higher mach numbers between
surface conditions required for high radiative emissivity and those
which may be thought necessary for preservinglaminar boundary layer,
then it may be better to choose the former .stationary convection flow of an electrically conductingstudy is made of the stationary convection
of an electrically conducting liquid in the space

number is determined for the case when the
temperature of both plates is the same .on the base pressure resulting from the interaction ofsupersonic external
it is shown that the two-dimensional base pressure problems relating to
base bleed into the wake of blunt-trailing-edge airfoils, or the
interaction between an external supersonic or sonic slipstream withsonic or subsonic jet stream ofjet engine, can be calculated by
theoretical considerationsconstant-pressure, isoenergetic, turbulent
mixing between the streams and the stagnant fluid in the wake is
assumedthe theoretical calculations are in good agreement with the
experimental results .the supersonic flow aboutblunt body of revolution

wave, and its location, aboutbody
of revolution moving at supersonic speeds is giventhe method provides also the means
to compute the flow characteristics in the shock layerthe fluid in which the motion
takes place is assumed to be in chemical equilibrium
within the shock layer ,. its thermochemical
properties must be knownthe essential
new features of the method are ..
a) it solves the direct problem, i. e., the initial data
are the conditions upstream and
the body shape ,. b) the integration of the fundamental
equations is done in the physical
plane and the difficulties inherent to other, less direct,
mathematical formulations
of the problem are avoideda physical interpretation of
the method is made which
is in accord with the analytical definition of the problem .data on shape and location of detached shock waves
accurate experimental data are given on the shape and the location
of detached shock waves on cones and spheres at mach numbers from 1.17
to 1.81the data are correlated to obtain equations that describe the
shock wavesthis knowledge of the shock waves should be useful in
calculations of the pressure distribution and the pressure drag of the
fore part of cones and spheresthe experimental data on shock waves
are compared with theory .critical combinations of shear and transverse direct
an exact solution andclosely concurring approximate
energy solution are given for the buckling of an infinitely long
flat plate under combined shear and transverse direct stress
with edges elastically restrained against rotationit was found
that an appreciable fraction of the critical stress in pure shear
may be applied to the plate without any reduction in the transverse
compressive stress necessary to produce bucklingan
interaction formula in general use was shown to be decidedly
conservative for the range in which it is supposed to apply .turbulent skin friction at high mach numbers and reynolds

were two-dimensional oversmooth flat surface with essentially zero
pressure gradient and with adiabatic conditions at the wallair and
helium were used as working fluidsan equivalence parameter for
comparing boundary layers in different working fluids is derived and
the experimental verification of the parameter is demonstratedexperimental results are compared with the results obtained by several
methods of calculating skin friction in the turbulent boundary layer .the problem of resistance in compressible fluidsthis report is restricted to the
resistance of bodies of revolution and
of cylindrical bodies of infinite length
moving with uniform velocity incompressible fluidin the case of bodies
of revolution it will be assumed
that the direction of the movement is
parallel to the axis of symmetryit will be assumed that the fluid satisfies
the equation of state of perfect

to obeying this equation the
fluid is characterized by the statement
that the intrinsic energy of the

n.p.l., r.a.e. and members of the british aircraft industry to achievesatisfactory design for an aircraft cruising at low supersonic speedsknowledge of shock-wave prediction, onset of wave drag and shockinduced
separation allows the basic design to be generalized forwide
range of parametersunpublished work by bagley on the relation of
aerodynamic coefficients and geometry is usedthe role of upper surface
velocity distribution is noted and methods for predicting pressure
distributions with shock waves are reviewed for both subsonic and
transonic flows .methods of boundary-layer control for postponing and alleviating
the use of boundary-layer control to increase the separation-free
margins of mach number and lift coefficient beyond the cruise point of
high-speed aircraft may often be preferred to design changes that impair
 the cruising performance or the landing and take-off characteristicsthe factors that influence the choice of method and details of its application
are discussed, emphasising particularly the need to maintain
effectiveness over most of the chord to cover the wide range of separation
positions encountered as the shock moves over the wing with changing
flight conditionsresearch at the national physical laboratory that has embraced highvelocity
blowing, vane and air-jet vortex generators, and, inpreliminary way, distributed suction, is briefly describedthe
relative merits of the various methods are discussed, and some results
achieved in their application are givenfor vortex generators, the importance is stressed of the vortex paths
determined by the interactions of neighbouring vortices and their
imagesthus, systems of counter-rotating vortices always leave the
surface in pairs and lose their effectivenessco-rotating systems are
therefore preferred for many applicationsblowing, which in windtunnel
tests gives results as good as or better than vortex generators
and does not have the disadvantage ofdrag penalty at cruise, has not
yet been assessed in flightair-jet vortex generators, which would
also avoid the drag penalty, show promise of producing significant
effects with relatively small blowing pressures and quantities .on the stability of two dimensional parallel flowsthis is the last part of the author's theory of the stability
of plane laminar motion(for partsand 2, cf. the same
quart. 3, 117-142, 218-234 (1945),. these rev. 7,225,226 .)
the stability character ofviscous fluid is considered in
detailthe author proceeds first to giveproof ofcriterion
of stability due to heisenberg ..  ifvelocity profile has an
number and phase velocity, the disturbance with the same
wave number is unstable in the real fluid when the reynolds
number is sufficiently largethis destabilizing effect of viscosity
is one of the most interesting phenomena in the
general stability theory,. its physical and mathematical significance
is carefully discussedthe author then discusses the behavior of the so-called
neutral curve for the two characteristic types of
velocity distribution, the boundary layer type profile and
the symmetrical profilethe asymptotic behavior of the
neutral curve is discussed firstthe main difference between
profiles with and withoutpoint of inflection is that the two
branches of the neutral curve approach and for
profiles withflex, but both converge to for the profile
withoutflexthe most important results are as followsfor sufficiently large reynolds number.  (2) there always

asymptotic behavior of the curves shows further
that there always existsmaximum value ofbeyond
which the motion is stable for all reynolds numbershence
the qualitative shape of the curve is determinedthe author proceeds to show that simple approximate
expressions for the stability limit can be obtained from his
general analysis forgiven velocity profilethese approximate
stability limits for plane poiseuille flow and blasius
flow are found to be r=5906 and r=502the reynolds
numbers are based on the width of the channel and the
displacement thickness, respectivelyfinally, the method
for computing the complete instability curve is presented
and the plane poiseuille case and the blasius problem worked
out in detailthe stability limit for blasius flow had been
given before by tollmien and schlichtingthe present more
exact computations agree well with tollmien's result as far
as the minimum critical reynolds number is concernedthe value found here is r=420the neutral curve for
poiseuille motion had not been obtained beforethe minimum
critical number here is found to be r=5314the
agreement with the estimate from the simple criterion mentioned
above is thus very gooda discussion of the physical significance of the viscous
effects and of future developments concludes the paper .transition form laminar to turbulent shear flowrecent experimental studies of transition from laminar to
turbulent shear flows are reviewedcertain common features
are emphasized and related to the stability theories of viscous
shear layersthe three-dimensional character, the unsteadiness,
and the nonlinear and random behavior of the latter stages
of the transition process are also examined .the design of intermediate vertical stiffeners on web
the correct design of intermediate vertical stiffeners on web plates
subjected to shear becomes very important when
the web plates are designed
to operate at loads close to their buckling loadsthis paper presents details
of an extensive series of tests conducted on
stiffened web plates subjected to
shearfrom the analysis of the results obtained
from these tests, new empirical
relationships between the flexural rigidity and
spacing of the intermediate
stiffeners and the buckling stress of the stiffened
web plate have been obtainedone interesting and important feature of
these new relationships is that
they define more clearly than hitherto the difference
in the behaviour of singleand
double-sided stiffeners .an experimental study of the flow field about swept and delta wingsseries of experiments was performed to define the flow field on the
upper surface of high aspect ratio swept wings and narrow delta wings at
 high angles of attackit was found that near the root section of either type of wing the flow
is conicalthe edge of the vortex sheet which originates at the leading
edge isstraight line whose position relative to the leading edge
depends only on incidenceon swept wings, the vortex edge turns downstream
as soon as the vortex sheet covers the front half of the wing
chord, and the flow under the vortex sheet outboard of that turning
point is uniform and parallel to the leading edge of the wingon narrow
delta wings, the conical symmetry persists almost to the trailing
edge .analytic study of induced pressure on long bodies ofsystematic study of induced pressures onseries

air and helium which cover the complete range of
nose bluntness considered(nose fineness ratios
varied from 0.4 to 4.)  available experimental results
were in good agreement with the characteristics

on the solution of these problems which are intractable by analytical
methods .an experimental investigation of the flow over blunt-nosed
shock shapes were observed and static pressures were measured
on spherically-blunted cones atnominal mach number of 5.8 overrange of reynolds numbers per inch from 97,000 to 238,000, for angles
of yaw fromto.  six combinations of the bluntness ratios 0.4, 0.8,
and 1.064 with the cone half angles 10, 20, and 40 were used in
determining the significant parameters governing pressure distributionthe pressure distribution on the spherical nose for both yawed
and unyawed bodies is predicted quite accurately by the modified
newtonian theory given by, where is the angle between the
normal tosurface element and the flow direction ahead of the bow
shockcone half angle was found to be the significant parameter in
determining the pressure distribution near the nose-cone junction and
over the conical afterbodyon the 40 spherical nosed cone models
the flow overexpanded with respect to the taylor-maccoll pressure in
the region of the spherical-conical juncture, after which the pressure
returned rapidly to the taylor-maccoll valuefor models with smaller
cone angles the region of minimum pressure occurred farther back on
the conical portion of the model, and the taylor-maccoll pressure was
approached more graduallythe shape of the pressure distributions
as described in nondimensional coordinates was independent of the
radius of the spherical nose and of the reynolds number over the range
of reynolds number per inch between .9710 and 2.3810integrated results for the pressure foredrag of the models at zero
yaw compared very closely with the predictions of the modified newtonian
approximation, except for models with large cone angles and small nose
radii, where the drag approaches the value given by the taylor-maccoll
theory for sharp cones .cantilever plate with concentrated edge loadthe author gives, by the method of finite differences, an
approximate solution of the problem offinite length

entrance of the stator is analyzed on the assumption of two-dimensional
flowthe rotor and stator losses assumed in the analysis are based on
the results of preliminary supersonic cascade teststhe results of
the analysis show that compression ratios per stage ofto 10 can be
obtained with adiabatic efficiency between 70 and 80 percentconsideration is also given in the analysis to the starting,
stability, and range of efficient performance of this type of
compressorthe desirability of employing variable-geometry stators
and adjustable inlet guide vanes is indicatedalthough either
supersonic or subsonic axial component of velocity at the stator
entrance can be used, the cascade test results suggest that higher
pressure recovery can be obtained if the axial component is supersonic .flow of gas through turbine latticespaper istranslation of chap.of the book /technical gasdynamics/

and loading distributionsthe
analysis deals withgeneralised quasi-cylinder ,.
that is one which, although lying
close tomean cylinder, need not possess
axial symmetrythe quasi-cylinder
is also permitted to be within the small
disturbance field of other separate
components, e.g.centre-bodybecause
the linearised theory is inadmissable
for internal duct flows close to and beyond
the first reflected characteristic cone,
the present solution is likewise invalid close

the machnozzle of theft3 ft high-supersonic-speed wind tunnel
are presented forrange of total pressure and humidity .free-flight measurements of the zero-lift drag and
five free-flight models were flown to measure the zero-lift drag and
body base pressure onstandard wind tunnel interference model overmach number range of 0.84 to 1.48roughness bands on the wings and body of the model are shown to
producesmall but definite increase in the zero-lift drag at all mach
numbersthe measured drag is in fair agreement with corresponding measurements
made in various transonic tunnels with differences that could plausibly
be explained as the effects of tunnel interferencethe effect ofsimulated wind tunnel support sting is shown to
increase the base pressurethe discrepancy between models with and
withoutsting is greatest at subsonic speeds and progressively
decreases with increasing mach number until at= 1.4 the sting has no
effect on base pressure .theoretical damping in roll and rolling moment duemethod of analysis based on slender-wing theory is developed
to investigate the characteristics in roll of slender cruciform wings
and wing-body combinationsthe method makes use of the
conformal mapping processes of classical hydrodynamics which
transform the region outsidecircle and the region outside
an arbitrary arrangement of line segments intersecting at the
originthe method of analysis may be utilized to solve other
slender cruciform wing-body problems involving arbitrarily
assigned boundary conditionsin the present report, the application of the method has
shown ..
differential incidence of both pairs of opposite surfaces of the
cruciform wing-body combinations are practically independent
of the body-diameter-maximum-span ratio up tovalue of this
ratio of 0.3arrangement is only 62 percent greater than that forcorresponding
planar wing-body combinationdence of both pairs of the opposing surfaces of the cruciform
wing-body arrangement, is only 52 percent greater than that
forcorresponding planar wing-body combinationunit surface deflection) of the cruciform wing-body arrangement
having four equally deflected panels is therefore 94 percent of
the corresponding planar wing-body combination .application of two dimensional vortex theory to thetheoretical investigation has been made ofgeneral method for
predicting the flow field behind the wings of plane and cruciform wing
and body combinations at transonic or supersonic speeds and slender configurations
at subsonic speedsthe wing trailing-vortex wake is
represented initially by line vortices distributed to approximate the
spanwise distribution of circulation along the trailing edge of the
exposed wing panelsthe afterbody is represented by corresponding
image vortices within the bodytwo-dimensional line-vortex theory is
then used to compute the induced velocities at each vortex and the
resulting displacement of each vortex is determined by means ofnumerical
stepwise integration procedurethe method was applied to the
calculation of the position of the vortex wake and the estimation of
downwash at chosen tail locations behind triangular-wing and
cylindrical-body combinations at supersonic speedsthe effects of
such geometric parameters as aspect ratio, angle of attack and
incidence, ratio of body radius to wing semi-span, and angle of bank on
the vortex wake behind wings of wing-body combinations were studiedthe relative importance of wing vortices, the corresponding image
vortices within the body, and body crossflow indetermining the the total
downwash was assessed atpossible tail locationit was found that the line-vortex method of this report permitted
the calculation of vortex paths behind wings of wing-body combinations
with reasonable facility and accuracya calculated sample wake shape
agreed qualitatively with one observed experimentally, and sample
results of the line-vortex method compared well with an available exact
crossflow-plane solutionan empirical formula was derived to estimate
the number  of vortices required per wing panel forsatisfactory
computation of downwash at tail locationsit was found that the shape
of the vortex wake and the ultimate number of rolled-up vortices behindwing depend on the circulation distribution along the wing trailing
edgefor the low-aspect-ratio plane wing and body combinations
considered, it appeared that downwash at horizontal tail locations is
largely determined except near the tail-body juncture by the wing
vortices alone for small ratios of body radius to wing semispan, and by
the body upwash alone for large values of that ratio .contributions of the wing panels to the forces andwind-tunnel investigation was
conducted atmach number of 1.96
and at reynolds numbers (based on the
mean aerodynamic chord of the
exposed wing) of 0.36 and 1.03 million
to determine the normal forces,
pitching moments, and rolling moments
contributed by each wing panel ofcruciform-wing and body combination
overwide range of combined
angles of pitch and rollthe wings
were triangular of aspect ratio 2,
and the body was an ogive-cylinder
combinationthe effects of forebody
length and roughness and of the
presence of the adjacent panels on these
panel contributions were determinedthe results of the investigation
show that large changes in the panel
forces and moments can occur as the
result of combined anglesa general
theoretical method based on slender-body
and strip theories was found to
yield results in good agreement with the
wind-tunnel measurementsthese
comparisons indicate that the changes in
the panel characteristics due to
combined angles are caused primarily bycross coupling between the sidewash
velocities due to angle of attack
and sideslip and by the presence
of forebody vortices due to crossflow
separationit was found that an
increase in forebody length increases
the effect of the forebody vortices
because of the dependence of the strength
of these vortices on the forebody
length .application of similar solutions to calculations of
an integral method for the rapid calculation of heat-transfer
distributions on yawed cylinders of arbitrary cross-sectional shape
and on bodies of revolution in high-speed flows is developed for
laminar boundary layersthe method involves the quadrature offunction of the pressure distribution (assumed given) and satisfies
the integral energy equation with the assumption of local similarity,
wherein the actual boundary-layer profiles at every station are
replaced by corresponding profiles fromfamily of similar solutionsthe method is compared with other local similarity methods and
with experimental heat-transfer data oncircular cylinder and onbody of revolution designed for large axial pressure gradientsgood
agreement between theory and data is obtained and it is shown that the
present integral method, in both its complete and simplified form, gives
generally better agreement with the data than certain other local similarity
methodsnumerical examples are presented showing that the effect of sweep

ft per sec., respectivelydata thus provided are used for comparison
with theory .a factor affecting transonic leading edge flow separationa change in flow pattern that was observed as the free-stream mach
number was increased in the vicinity of 0.8 was described in naca
technical note 1211 by lindsey, daley, and humphreysthe flow on the
upper surface behind the leading edge of an airfoil at an angle of
attack changed abruptly from detached flow with an extensive region of
separation to attached supersonic flow terminated byshock wavein
the present paper, the consequences of shock-wave--boundary-layer interaction
are proposed asfactor that may be important in determining the
conditions under which the change in flow pattern occurswhen the
mach number is high enough, the attached-flow pattern exists because
then the shock wave is far enough behind the leading edge to keep the
influence of the high pressure behind the shock wave from extending
through the boundary layer to the immediate vicinity of the leading edge
and affecting the flow theresome experimental evidence in support of
the importance of shock-wave--boundary-layer interaction is presented .compilation of information on the transonic attachment
schlieren photographs have been compiled of the two-dimensional flow
at transonic speeds past 37 airfoils having variously shaped profiles,
some of which are related and vary in thickness and camberthe data
for these airfoils were analyzed to provide basic information on the
flow changes involved and to determine factors affecting transonic-flow
attachment, which istransition from separated to unseparated flow at
the leading edges of two-dimensional airfoils at fixed angles of attack
as the subsonic mach number is increased .evaluation of high angle-of-attack aerodynamic derivative
the problem of stall flutter is approached in two waysfirst,
using the m.i.t.-naca airfoil oscillator, the aerodynamic reactions on
wings oscillating harmonically in pitch and translation in the stall
range have been measured, evaluated, and correlated where possible with
available published data, with the purpose of providing empirical information
where no aerodynamic theory existsthe major effects of
reynolds number, airfoil shape, and reduced frequency on the aerodynamic
reactions have been reaffirmedno instances of negative damping were
observed in pure translatory motion and the ranges of negative damping
occurring in pure pitch had the same general trends noted by other
experimentersdata on the time-average values in the stall range of
both lift and moment are presented for the first timesecond, the results of numerous experimental observations of stall
flutter have been reviewed and the various known attempts at its prediction
have been examined, compared, and extendedthe sharp drop in
critical speed and change topredominantly torsional oscillation
usually associated with the transition from classical to stall flutter
is apparently primarily but not entirely caused by the marked changes
in moment due to pitchfairly good stall-flutter predictions have
been reported only when adequate empirical data for this aerodynamic
reaction happened to be available for the desired airfoil shape,
reynolds number range, and reduced-frequency rangea semiempirical
method of predicting the variations of moment in pitch with airfoil
shape, reduced frequency, initial angle of attack, and amplitude of
oscillation has been presented .some effects of variations in several parameters including
an experimental investigation has been made of some effects of
variations in several parameters, including fluid density, on the
flutter characteristics of light uniform cantilever wingsthe assortment
of wings tested coveredvariety of positions of the elastic axis
and center of gravity and values of the aspect ratio of 8, 6, and.
the relative-density parameter (whereis representative of the
ratio of fluid density to wing mass) was varied overrange of values
from 1.2 to nearly 14special emphasis has been placed on the lower
valuesthe experimental investigation has been supplemented by an analytical
investigation based on the two-dimensional aerodynamic theory for
incompressible flowinfew instances corrections for the effects of
finite span have been madein general, the theoretical results
followed the trends indicated by experiment except at very low values of
the relative-density parameterfor these low values
the analytical considerations employed indicatedfreedom from flutter
not found experimentallyat higher values of the flutter-speed
coefficient is shown to decrease with decreasing values of and
to be nearly proportional to the inverse of the square root of the air
density .calculated and measured pressure distributions over the midspan section
pressures were simultaneously measured in the variable-density tunnel
at 54 orifices distributed over the midspan section of5 by 30 inch
rectangular model of the n.a.c.a. 4412 airfoil at 17 angles of attack
ranging from -dash 20degree to 30degree atreynolds number of approximately
3,000,000accurate data were thus obtained for studying the
deviations of the results of potential-flow theory from measured results
technique are presentedit is shown that theoretical calculations made either at the effective
angle of attack or atgiven actual lift do not accurately describe the
 observed pressure distribution over an airfoil sectionthere is
therefore developedmodified theoretical calculation that agrees reasonably
well with the measured results of the tests of the n.a.c.a. 4412
 section and that consists of making the calculations and evaluating the
 circulation by means of the experimentally obtained lift at the effective
angle of attack,. i.e., the angle that the chord of the model makes
 with the direction of the flow in the region of the section under
considerationin the course of the computations the shape parameter
is modified, thus leading tomodified or an effective profile shape
that differs slightly from the specified shape .an approach to the flutter problem in real fluidsan approximate theory of airfoils in unsteady motion inviscous
fluid is proposed, in which viscous effects are accounted for by
relaxing the kutta condition and replacing it byrelation derived from
experiments in steady flowapplications here, are limited to moderate
viscous effects below the stallthe possibility of one-degree-offreedom
flutter is discussed under this assumptionthe discussion is
partly extrapolated to the domain of stall fluttersome possibilities
of further development of this theory for the stalled case are
indicated .on the application of mathieu functions in the theory
an account is given of explicit solutions in terms of mathieu function

flow past oscillating airfoilsthe results are applied to the
calculation of three-dimensional corrections for the two-dimensional
theory and the effect of the incorporation of the three-dimensional
effects on the mathieu function solution of the two-dimensional
problem is shownthe developments are formal and must be supplemented
by an appreciable amount of numerical calculations before the
theory can be applied to specific problems .wake ofsatellite traversing the ionospherethe particle treatment is applied tostudy of the

densities are increased over their ambient valuesformulae for the electrohydrodynamic drag onwire, and onlarge disk are obtained .motion of thin bodies inhighly rarefied plasmamagnetic effects are considered negligible,
and the velocity of the body is inrange between the
electron and positive ion thermal speedsthe self-consistent field approach is used in which the
electron distribution is assumed to be maxwellian,
while the positive ion distribution function is given
by the /collision-free/ boltzmann equationit is assumed that the ion reflection at the body surface
is specular, and the body is sufficiently thin so
that the ion distribution function issmall perturbation
ofmaxwellian distributionthe solution for
the simple case ofdielectric body withgiven surface
charge, as well as some general properties to
be expected forconducting body are given .induction drag onlarge negatively charged satellite
an induction drag, experienced bycharged satellite during its traversal of the
ionosphere, has been theoretically postulated by
several authorsprevious 'exact' treatments
of the problem are inapplicable to large systems, and
the semiempirical approach of jastrow
and pearse may yield somewhat questionable resultsthe present description initially considers
the satellite ascompletely permeable spherical
shell of charge, thus avoiding the difficult
boundary conditions introduced by the 'exact'
linearized treatmentthe effects of permeability
are then shown to be approximately removable
by means of an iterative processa
final result, apparently valid to within an order of
magnitude, is obtained for the drag force
arising solely from electrical effectsits magnitude
is considerably less than that obtained by
jastrow and pearse .interaction ofcharged satellite with the ionospherethe problem of the ion density distribution aroundcharged satellite has been treated bynumerical method
which does not require linearization of the equations or restriction
to infinitesimal objectshowever, magnetic field
effects were not considered, andnumber of other simplifying
assumptions were requiredsome sample calculations
for spherical satellites are presented, illustrating the general
character of the satellite wakecalculations of the socalled
/charge drag/ were also made, yielding results qualitatively
similar to those previously obtained by jastrow and pearse .some physical interpretations of magnetohydrodynamic duct flowsthis note presents some physical interpretations of magnetohydrodynamic
duct flows with various boundary conditions viewed in the light of the

these casesfrom the eulerian equations of motion the
author obtains the expression for in terms of the
parameter and derivatives ofthe general form
of is introduced and the appropriate solution for the
pressureis obtainedby integration aroundcontour
enclosing the body, expressions are obtained, analogous to
the blasius formulae, for the force and couple on any
cylinder in this type of flowthese formulae are applied to
the case ofsymmetrical joukowsky airfoilthe method of
conformal transformation is employed in the determination
ofthe boundary condition of tangential flow at the
airfoil surface must be satisfied by the total flow in the airfoil
plane, but this condition leads toboundary condition for
in the transformed planethe kutta-joukowsky condition
of finite velocity at the trailing edge also leads tocondition on in this planefrom these conditions and the
general expression for the circulation and the strengths
of the doublets and quadruplets required for the force and

center are also calculated and are presented
graphically as functions of .the influence of two-dimensional stream shear on airfoil maximum liftthe cornell aeronautical laboratory is conductingprogram of
theoretical and experimental research on low-speed aerodynamics as
applied to stol and vtol aircraftthe objective of this program is to
re-examine certain aspects of classical aerodynamic information, in the
light of low-speed flight requirements, with the aim of seeking aerodynamic
processes which might be exploited to enhance law-speed performanceone aspect of propeller-driven aircraft which has recently received
increasing attention is the existence of strong gradients of longitudinal
velocity, or shear, in the propeller slipstreamthis slipstream
shear interacts withwing surface and can alter the wing
characteristicsin theoretical treatments ofwing interacting withpropeller slipstream, the first important simplification is the
replacement of the slipstream with an ideal uniform
jet, free of all velocity
gradientsthe application of these theories requires that one equate
the actual slipstream to an effective uniform jetone method employed
is to assume the uniform jet hasmomentum flux equal to the
average in the propeller slipstreamthese and similar procedures
are well founded on momentum considerations., however, the implicit
assumption is that the flow nonuniformity, the shear, does not influence
the wing characteristics .several approximate analyses of the bending ofrectangular
three methods of approximating the deflections and
moments occurring inrectangular cantilever plate subjected
to uniform normal pressure over its entire surface
are presented in this paperthe first is the application of
the well-known finite-difference procedurethe second
and third are collocation methods, one based upon polynomial
solutions of the lagrange equation, the other employing
/mixed/ hyperbolic-trigonometric terms satisfying
this equationin the last two methods the boundary
conditions are satisfied exactly along the clamped edge and
atfinite number of points along the free edges of the platethe results obtained for the particular case ofcantilever
plate with uniform normal load indicate that the use ofrelatively small number of points in the collocation
method yields values of deflections and moments that are
in substantial agreement with those given by the finitedifference
procedureit cannot be concluded from these
results that the collocation method using the assumed
functions will give satisfactory results with fewer points
than the finite-difference method for cantilever plates with
loading different from the one investigated .modified cross-lees mixing theory for supersonic separated
re-examination of the crocco-lees method has shown that the
previous quantitative disagreement between theory and experiment
in the region of flow up to separation was caused primarily
by the improper c(k) relation assumeda new c(k) correlation,
based on low-speed theoretical and experimental data and on
supersonic experimental results has been developed and found to
be satisfactory for accurate calculation of two-dimensional,
laminar, supersonic flows up to separationa physical model which incorporates the concept of the /dividing/
streamline and the results of experimentaccording to this
physical model, viscous momentum transport is the essential
mechanism in the zone between separation and the beginning of
reattachment, while the reattachment process is, on the contrary,
an essentially inviscid processthis physical model has been
translated into crocco-lees languages usingsemiempirical
approach, and approximate c(k) and f(k) relations have been
determined for the separated and reattaching regionsthe
results of this analysis have been applied to the problem of shockwave,
laminar-boundary-layer interaction, and satisfactorystudy of separated and reattaching regions of flow has led to
quantitative agreement with experiment has been achieved .a study of flow fields about some typical blunt-nosed
complete inviscid flow fields about three model axisymmetric
configurations have been determined numericallyconfigurations
decreasing bluntness) and flight conditions have been selected so
as to indicate separately effects of nose shape, drag coefficient,
flight mach number, and thermodynamic behavior of the gas (either
ideal calorically perfect gas or air in equilibrium dissociation)results are presented for thirteen casesparticular attention is
devoted to interpretation and, when possible, correlation of pressure
distributions on, and shock shapes about, the cylindrical afterbodiesit is found that ..  (a) the correlation of pressure
distributions on bodies having nonspherical noses involves interpretive
modifications of the law suggested by blast wave analogyalso
shocks about these bodies are not described by parabolae,. (b) for
all configurations there is substantial influence of gas behavior
on shock shape,. this, however, can be correlated in terms of the
gas conditions alonggenerally defined streamline,. (c) the shock
layer can generally be divided into two regions (the first bound by
the body and the aforementioned streamline, the second delimited
by this streamline and the shock) wherein flow properties can
either be approximated by simple laws or correlated ..  (d) for each
configuration knowledge of the complete flow field in one flight
condition (even pertaining to ideal gas flow) can be used to
estimate features of flows under general flight conditions including
those where equilibrium dissociation is encountered .on laminar boundary-layer flow nearposition of separationsingularities are considered in the solution of
the laminar boundary-layer equations
atposition of separationa singularity of
the type here considered occurred
incareful numerical computation by hartree
forlinearly decreasing velocity
distribution outside the boundary layer ,. it may
occur generallywhenever it does
occur, the boundary-layer equations cease to be
valid at and near separation on the
upstream side, and also downstream of separationthe work suggests that singularities
may arise in the solution of non-linear
parabolic equations due to their
non-linearitythe formulae found may help
computers of laminar boundary layers,
who desire more thanrough solution, to have
an end-point at which to aim .a new series for calculation of steady laminar boundarynew and general method for solving
problems of plane and steady laminar
boundary layer flows in incompressible
fluids with arbitrary outer pressure

is based on the introduction of the
dimensionless quantities
as new independent spatial variablesordinates, u(x) the given outer velocity
distribution,the kinematic viscosity .)
the solution of the boundary layer problem
is then given aspower series inwith coefficient functions depending on.
this series isformally exact solution
of the boundary layer problemthe new series solution has the following qualities ..have the significance only of cartesiancoordinates, the influence of wallcurvature being neglected in boundarylayer theory, the new coordinatesare adjusted to the data of the specialproblem in any case of applicationthe new variables representlogicaldevelopment of former efforts inthe field of boundary-layer flow calculationwith other series solutions known forsome special cases is that the leadingterm of the new series satisfiesexactly the outer boundary conditionat all cross-sections along the walltherefore, the succeeding terms givecorrections only in the inner part ofthe boundary layeraccordingly,taking also no.into account, the zeroorder term by itself givesgoodapproximation for the boundary layer flow .on the solution of the laminar boundary layer equationsthe theory of the laminar boundary layer
offersmeans of determining the skin friction
under the assumption ofgiven velocity distribution
outside the boundary layerowing to the
mathematical difficulties, however, exact solutions
are possible only when the velocity distribution
is expressed assimple function of the distance
along the surfacemore complicated velocity distributions
necessitate recourse to the method of
expansion in series or that of step-by-step calculations,
but the labor involved is too great for the
methods to be of practical useapproximate
method due to pohlhausen (1921), which had long
been recommended for general use, givesreasonably
accurate solution inregion of accelerated
flow, but recently its adequacy inregion of
retarded flow has been questionedseparation of
flow may actually occur where the solution of
pohlhausen fails to give itmore recently howarth
solution, which gives fairly reasonable results inregion of retarded flowhowarth's solution essentially consists in solving
the boundary layer equations for the particular
case in which the velocityoutside the boundary
layer decreases linearly with the distancemeasured
along the surface, and utilizing the solution
by replacing the actual distribution ofbycircumscribing polygon of infinitesimal sidestherefore, it is assumed that the velocity distribution
at any section depends on the velocity
gradient du/dx at that section only, being affected
by the conditions upstream only in so far as this
affects the momentum thickness.  in other words,
the velocity distribution across the boundary layer
is determined byparameter .correlated incompressible and compressible boundary
the boundary-layer equations forcompressible
fluid are transformed into those for an incompressible
fluid, assuming that the boundary
is thermally insulating, that the viscosity is
proportional to the absolute temperature, and
that the prandtl number is unityvarious
results in the theory of incompressible boundary
layers are then taken over into the compressible
theoryin particular, the existence of
method for retarded flows is applied to determine
the point of separation foruniformly
retarded main stream velocitya comparison with
an exact solution is used to show that this
method givescloser approximation than does pohlhausen's .approximate methods fore predicting separation properties

paper and is probably the most accurate and the simplest of all methods
at present in usemodified numerical functions are also given for
thwaites's method of predicting the main characteristics of the boundary
layer over the whole surface, which improve the accuracy of the method .photo-thermoelasticitythis paper summarizes the optical and physical properties

placeholderwaves in supersonic flowin this chapter we shall mainly consider problems of steady, two-dimensional
(plane) supersonic flowusing the fact that in this case
there issteady wave system, we shall find solutions by an indirect
approachthat is, we shall first study the conditions under which
simple stationary waves may exist in the flow, and then find the flow
boundaries to which they correspond or which may be fitted to
themin this procedure the limited upstream influence insupersonic

the effects of stream velocity gradients on airfoil maximum
lift are defined with experimental data obtained insimulated

that when positioned near the slipstream plane of symmetry, the
airfoil maximum lift varies markedly with location in the slipstreamin moving the airfoil from above to below the slipstream
plane of symmetry throughtotal distance corresponding
to the airfoil thickness, force data and boundary-layer observations
show that boundary-layer separation is delayed to higher
angles of attack, and the airfoil maximum lift is doubledit is concluded that the destalling effect observed in the nonuniform
slipstream is not associated with slipstream boundary
interference, but stems from the influence of the large local slipstream
shear on airfoil characteristicsthe effects of uniform
and nonuniform shear on airfoil lift and pressure distribution are
discussed, within the framework of existing first-order, smallshear
theory, to show that these effects of shear tend to promote
stalla pohlhausen calculation of the laminar boundary layer
instream with shear is used to identify and to assess the effects
of stream shear on boundary-layer separation criteriait is
demonstrated that these effects are negligibly small, and that the
uniform-flow criterion appliesit is concluded on the basis of
the experimental data that the observed destalling phenomenon
stems fromshear effect of higher order than those treated in the
inviscid theoriesit is hypothesized that it issecond-order
effect, fixed by the product of the stream shear and the derivative
of the shear, which was large in the present experiments .linear heat flow incomposite slabthe temperature is determined asfunction of position and

calculate the pressure distribution on any body of revolution at
angle of attack forward of any separated region of the flow, and
also to calculate the flow at points off the body surfaceafter
the basic equations of the method have been derived, its accuracy
is exhibited by comparison with analytic solutions for ellipsoids

author considers the equation of the yawing motion ofmissile,
derived withseries of customary assumptions and with the distance
traveled as the independent variablehis assumptions include
the linearity of the aerodynamic forces, the constancy of the
aerodynamic coefficients with respect to mach number, the absence
of spin, and the absence of gravityif to these assumptions
one could add the common ballistic assumption ofconstant air
density, the coefficients of this equation would have been condamped
sinusoidsin ballistics any slow variation of these coefstant,
and the solution would have been simply the exponentiallyficients
is usually treated by adding an approximate correction
term to the damping rate (which is spoken of as the wkb perturbation)however, withbody entering the planetary atmosphere the
variation of the air density is apparently of greater essence (this
ispoint not stated explicitly in this brief communication), and
the equation is of the typethe author shows that withseries of further transformations
the equation can be reduced to the form
the solutions of which are confluent hypergeometric
functionsthese functions are defined as series involving
gamma functions, and withseries of further assumptions
can be reduced to laguerre polynomials and bessel functionsit is certainly nice to have an exact solution toproblem which
has heretofore been extensively treated by approximations and by
the numerical approachthis reviewer is puzzled, however, as to
the practical significance of the proposed approachan idealization
is of value in that it facilitates our understanding,. and the
numerical approach, in that it allows refinements of the problem,
freeing us from the necessity of idealizingbut the proposed solution
is certainly more difficult to refine than the original problem,.
and it is certainly not simple (the solution of the original
equation is not the value of z, but the various /reverse/ transformations
of z)an evaluation ofseries in practice must compete
with the numerical approach,. and the equation suggested is of the
zero)viewing the problem /afresh/ (in the light of the /computer
revolution/ and without the constraints imposed by the prior
art), it seems at least equally easy to /standardize/ the solutions
of the original equation .joule heating in magnetohydrodynamic free-convection

in the continuous quest for improved means of transportation,
attention is currently focused on the ground-effect
machineas there is no physical contact between the vehicle
and the terrain over which it operates, its performance should
be similar over land and waterhowever, over water there is
an additional resistance to motion due to the gravity-wave

experimental confirmation has been required that insupersonic
turbine the leading edges of the rotor governs the rotor incidence and,
hence, the gas exit angle from the nozzlesevidence has also been
required that, once the rotor incidence has been allowed for, there is
no adverse effect of the rotors on the nozzle flow, even when the rotors
havelarge turning anglethe present test cascade represented the stationary configuration
ofturbine of 2.5 nozzle mach number and 74 swirl angle, the rotors
being designed to operate at 1.9 relative mach number and to provideturning angle of 140in the tests, fully supersonic flow could be
established through the system, but the losses were fairly high and an
increase in loss of about 25 per cent would have caused choking in the

the temperature of the solid at the interface,
since this can be observed experimentally
without much difficultysolutions are
obtained for this quantity which coverrange of practically plausible relaxation times
and 'wall effect' parametersit is essential
to include proper temperature jump

experimentallyit was found that, for jet stagnation pressures greater than that
required for the nozzle to reach its design mach number, an increase
of jet mach number reduced the base pressuresimilarly the base
pressure increased with increase of the ratio of jet diameter to base
diameter and, at high jet stagnation pressures, base pressures higher
than free stream static pressure were foundthe base pressure was
independent of free stream reynolds numbers greater thanx 10 per

for angles of attack up to 15 and for the one (high) roll
rate which accompanies30 aileron deflection angle of the
wingstests conducted at zero roll rate but with the wing deflection
maintained, revealed large forces in the magnus direction,
thereby providing the basis for understanding magnus effects due
to wing-tail interferencea semiempirical theory is proposed to explain the experimental
dataa simplified model of the wake behind the wings is introduced
to predict tail-interference factorsgood agreement with
the data is obtainedthis magnus effect is opposite in direction to the classical
magnus lift onspinning cylinder ,. it is much larger than either
that effect or the one onmissile with only one set of finswingtail
interference is the predominant source of the effect ,. roll rate
only modifies the basic interference mechanism .a note on application of transonic linearization to
the profile ofsymmetric airfoil of unit length withround
leading edge can be expressed, in general, as
where p(x) hasfinite slope at=.  it is well known that
the conventional sub- and supersonic linear theories of compressible
flow break down in the neighborhood of suchround
leading edge due to the failure of the small-disturbance assumptionthe linearized transonic flow theory has the same shortcoming,
but if the determination of the sonic point on the airfoil
plays an important role in any more advanced theory--e.g.,
spreiter's local-linearization method or hosokawa's method of
refinement--this theoretical barrier will become more serious
because the sonic point is usually located inflow region near
the leading edge that may be greatly affected by the roundness .laminar, transitional and turbulent heat transfer to

of the cylinder and over the flare the predictions are only qualitatively
correct, and underestimate the heating rate byfactor as

the transonic flow roundtwo-dimensional airfoil at incidence
is often determined by the type of flow in the leading-edge
regionif the flow separates at the leading edge at low speeds it
is liable to attach as the speed increases, often quite suddenlya review of this change with laminar or with turbulent boundary
layers re-emphasizes the importance of fixing transition when
making model tests at transonic speeds in order to obtain flows
closest to full-scale conditionsit is shown that similar airfoils with attached leading-edge
flow show transonic similarity upstream of the terminal shock .note on the three-point boundary layer problem for

oseen's equations for unsteady flow are employed to obtainlinearized solution based ondiscontinuous-wake modelthe analysis is employed to estimate the viscous correction to
unsteady lift and moment at large reynolds numberif the
asymptotic solution is not too slowly convergent, the correction
is of the order of the ratio of the logarithm of reynolds number
to the reynolds numberthe theory is preliminary in nature
as it is limited by the accuracy of oseen's equations and is
restricted to small angle of attackhowever, it also shows that
the generalized trailing-edge condition for potential flow is
reasonable and might predict the essential correction inreal

ence of short luminous streaks, which disappear suddenly as the
pressure is decreased belowcm hg for air, and below 0.8 cm
hg for argonboth air and argon, which show the main features of the flow
fieldabove the transition pressure, the intensity of radiation
from the wake is always associated with fluctuations that appear
to be the same phenomenon as the drum-camera streaksthe appearance of the streaks in the drum camera and photomultiplier
data is interpreted as transition from laminar to turbulent
flow in the viscous wake, because experimental evidence
shows that their appearance is not controlled by chemical,
radiative, or ablative processes, but depends on aerodynamic
effectsthis conclusion is supported by other experiments based
on optical and schlieren techniquesthe transition in the wake

solution of rectangular plate problems, with various boundary conditions
and under various transverse loads, are developedthe solution of
one particular problem on deuce is also described .chemical kinetics of high temperature airwhenhypersonic object enters earth's atmosphere,shock
wave is formed in front of it, and the air passing through this
shock wave is heated to high temperaturesthe shock heated
molecules equilibrate their translational and rotational degrees
of freedom withindistance offew mean free pathsto achieve equilibrium, it is necessary to excite vibration,
dissociate molecules, produce new molecules and produce ions
and electronsthe problem is complex, since all these phenomena
occur simultaneously and because the reaction rates depend
on the temperature, density and composition which are changing
during the relaxation toward equilibriumthe experimental techniques used to investigate these reactions
are briefly discussed along with the resulting rate expressions
obtained by the various investigatorsa compilation
of the rate expressions for these reactions representing the
author's evaluation of all the available data is presentedseveral pertinent problems which are not yet completely understood
and which still require theoretical and experimental investigation
are outlinedcomputed concentration, temperature
and density time histories are shown for three different shock
speeds in airthe time rate of change of concentration for
each chemical reaction is also shown and regimes of importance
for the various processes are discussed .ablation of glassy materials around blunt bodies of
the steady-state equations of motion forthin layer of an incompressible glassy material on the
surface of an ablating and radiating blunt
body are reduced tofirst-order ordinary differential
equation which is integrated numericallythis solution is coupled with the solution of the air
boundary layer for both laminar and turbulent
heat transfer with or without mass vaporization of
the ablating materialthe distribution of the
effective energy of ablation around the body is thus
obtained forcone cylinder withhemispherical
cap that re-enters the atmosphere at hypersonic
flight speeds, and has quartz as the ablating
materialit is found that the ablation process from
turbulent heating is more efficient than from
the laminar case because of increased vaporizationthis solution of the equations of motion at the
stagnation point has been verified by are wind tunnel
experimentsthe present state of development
of the are wind tunnel does not permit its use for
experimental investigations of ablation around
blunt bodies under turbulent heating .generalized heat transfer formulas and graphsutilizing the research results of previously
reported investigations of the laminar, turbulent and
radiative heat transfer in dissociated air, some
generalized formulas for calculating heat transfer
are givengraphs for determining the laminar
heat transfer, momentum thickness reynolds
number, and turbulent heat transfer distributions
around an axisymmetric body are also giventhese heat transfer correlations are valid for velocities
between 6000 and 26,000 fps and for altitudes
up to 250,000 ftthis range of velocities and
altitudes covers the important re-entry regime of
practical re-entry trajectories having interest todayin the last section of this report these generalized
results are specialized for icbm nose cone re-entry
applicationsthese formulas and graphs
may be found useful for making rapid engineering
estimates and preliminary design evaluations
of the heating problems associated with re-entry
into earth's atmosphere .closing reply to comments on generalized heat transfer
inrecent paper (1), detra and hidalgo have shown
that, when the boundary layer is turbulent, the heat
flux per unit area at the sonic point ofnose cone may exceed
the corresponding laminar heat flux per unit area at the
stagnation pointthe ratio of turbulent sonic-point to
laminar stagnation-point heat flux per unit area has been
estimated (2) to vary from about 1.0 to 10 forhemispherical
nose as the reynolds number (based on nose diameter)
increases from 10 to 10since for an axisymmetric body
the surface area in the vicinity of the sonic point greatly
exceeds the area in the vicinity of the stagnation point, the
ratio of turbulent to laminar heat fluxes to the entire body
will be much greater than the above quoted ratios of heat
fluxes per unit area .numerical comparison between exact and approximate
this paper presents numerical results of
exact calculations of the inviscid equilibrium flow aboutlong hemisphere-cylinder in motion
at hypersonic velocitya comparison is made with blast
wave as well as free layer theories of hypersonic
flowasresult of the comparison, it is concluded
that the second-order blast wave theory can
be used for the purpose of finding the shock shape and
the body pressure distributionhowever,
this procedure is definitely empirical and cannot be justified
on rational or theoretical groundswe show that the presently calculated radial distribution
of energy is radically different than that
given by blast wave theoryif body shapes other than
those considered here are of interest, the
only reliable approach at the present time is to carry out
numerical calculationsit was found
that for certain flight velocities the pressure on the body
does not decay to free stream pressure
monotonically but overexpands .a numerical comparison between exact and approximate
this note refers to paper of same title by feldman in ars j. 30,
validity of blast wave theory cannot be justified on rational or
theoretical grounds because of different values of energy in cross
flow field as calculated by this theory and by method of characteristicspresent note questions this conclusion, shows reasonably
good agreement when energy is calculated for points where shock
location, streamline pattern, and velocity, temperature, and pressure
profiles are adequately defined, and still better agreement
when energy is calculated from flow quantities provided by-characteristics
methodresults are checked using data from independent
sourceconclusion is reached that blast wave theory is
still valid .experimental measurements of turbulent transition motion,
the laminar-turbulent transition behind 0.500-in.-diameter
spheres at 8500 ft sec and behind
measured asfunction of pressureschlieren
motion-picture techniques were used to analyze the
turbulent motion and the results are describedautocorrelation functions of the density fluctuations
of the turbulence have been measuredfrom
these values has been calculated and the results
are given for several positions in the turbulent
trail at 30 mm hg downstream air pressurein addition
the authors' previous measurements of the
gross radial growth of the turbulent wake have been
extended to pressures of 10 mm hg for the case
of 0.500-in.-diameter spheres and to the trail behindheat transfer at the forward stagnation point of blunt
relations are presented for the calculation of heat transfer at
the forward stagnation point of both two-dimensional and axially symmetric
blunt bodiesthe relations for the heat transfer, which were
obtained from exact solutions to the equations of the laminar boundary
layer, are presented in terms of the local velocity gradient at the
stagnation pointthese exact solutions include effects of variation
of fluid properties, prandtl number, and transpiration coolingexamples
illustrating the calculation procedure are also included .a theoretical study of the effect of upstream transpiration-cooling
an analysis is presented which predicts
the skin-friction and heattransfer
characteristics ofcompressible,
laminar boundary layer onsolid flat plate preceded byporous
section that is transpiration cooledthe analysis is restricted toprandtl
number of unity and linear
variation of viscosity with temperaturethe local skin friction has been
found to havelow value in the
region of transpiration cooling and then
to increase until it approaches
the value forcompletely nonporous surface
asymptoticallythe initial
increase in local skin friction is rapid
as half of the ultimate increase
occurs indistance beyond the porous
region that is about 20 percent of
the length of the porous region for all rates
of injectionwhen the
total coolant flow rate is kept constant
and the porous length is varied,
it is found that the average skin friction
onpartially porous plate is
slightly lower than that onfully porous platethe local heat transfer behaves inmanner similar to that of the
local skin frictionit is found, in
an example, that the temperature
at the end ofpartially porous plate
could be maintained at about the
same temperature asfully porous plate
by doubling the total rate of
coolant flow .a geometric problem related to the optimum distribution
the problem studied may be regarded asproblem of geometryits simplest form (loosely stated) is then as follows ..mountain rises up from the x-y planedetermine the exact
shape of the mountain knowing only the cross-sectional area of
every possible cut which can be made through the mountain withvertical planeinmore complicated version of the problem,
the given information might be restricted to the cross-sectional
area of every cut which can be made byvertical plane inclined
less than 45 to the y-axisthis latter case has direct applications to certain minimum
drag problems in supersonic flowthe shape of the mountain
corresponds to the (unknown) shape of the optimum lift distribution
onplanar wingthe cross-sectional area ofcut is
the integrated value of the lift alongstraight line crossing the
wing plan formforrestricted range of line inclinations, these
optimum integrated lift values can sometimes be determined
directlyhere it is assumed that they are giventhe problem in its simplest form was originally solved by
radon, who found solutions forlarge class of such problemsthe derivation presented here may perhaps be more readily
understood .concerning the effect of compressibility on laminar
the theory of compressible flow inlaminar
boundary layer has been developed for the
case when the viscosity is assumed to be
proportional to the absolute temperature and the
prandtl number is unity(these assumptions
may be compared with the empirical relations
suggested by cope .)
it is shown thattransformation of the ordinate
normal to the layer can lead tosimplified
form of equation of motion very similar to the
ordinary incompressible equation but modified
bymultiplicative factorin the pressure
termthis factor is greater than unity at the
boundary and tends to one at the outside of
the layerseveral particular solutions are considered
including accelerated flow withlinearly
increasing velocity and retarded flow alongflat plate withlinearly decreasing velocitythe general implications of the theory are
discussed and qualitative conclusions are drawn
when the mainstream velocity starts fromstagnation point, rises tomaximum and
subsequently fallsit is concluded that for
suchvelocity distribution increasing compressibility
will reduce the skin friction, increase
the boundary layer thickness and cause
earlier separation as compared with the incompressible
flow with the same mainstream velocity
distribution and the kinematic viscosity corresponding
to conditions at the stagnation point .the law of the wake in the turbulent boundary layerafter an extensive survey of mean-velocity profile measurements
in various two-dimensional incompressible turbulent boundarylayer
flows, it is proposed to represent the profile bylinear
combination of two universal functionsone is the well-known
law of the wallthe other, called the law of the wake, is
characterized by the profile atpoint of separation or reattachmentthese functions are considered to be established empirically, bystudy of the mean-velocity profile, without reference to any
hypothetical mechanism of turbulenceusing the resulting
complete analytic representation for the mean-velocity field,
the shearing-stress field for several flows is computed from the
boundary-layer equations and compared with experimental datathe development ofturbulent boundary layer is ultimately
interpreted in terms of an equivalent wake profile, which supposedly
represents the large-eddy structure and isconsequence of the
constraint provided by inertiathis equivalent wake profile is
modified by the presence ofwall, at whichfurther constraint is
provided by viscositythe wall constraint, although it penetrates
the entire boundary layer, is manifested chiefly in the sublayer flow
and in the logarithmic profile near the wallfinally, it is suggested that yawed or three-dimensional flows
may be usefully represented by the same two universal functions,
considered as vector rather than scalar quantitiesif the wall
component is defined to be in the direction of the surface shearing
stress, then the wake component, at least in the few cases studied,
is found to be very nearly parallel to the gradient of the pressure .local heat transfer and recovery temperature onyawed
local heat transfer, equilibrium temperatures,
and wall static pressures have been measured oncircular cylinder at yaw angles of 0, 10, 20, 40,
and 60the reynolds number range of the tests
was from 1x10 to 4x10 based on cylinder
diameterincreasing the yaw angle fromto 40 increased
the stagnation-line heat-transfer coefficients by 100
to 180 percenta further increase in yaw angle to
heat-transfer coefficientsat zero yaw angle the boundary layer over the
entire front half of the cylinder was laminar but at
yaw angles of 40 and 60 it was evidently completely
turbulent, including the stagnation line, as determined
by comparison of local heat-transfer coefficients
with theoretical predictionsthe level of heating
rates and the nature of the chordwise distribution
of heat transfer indicated thatflow mechanism
different from the conventional transitional boundary
layer may have existed at the intermediate yaw angles
of 10 and 20at all yaw angles the peak heattransfer
coefficient occurred at the stagnation line
and the chordwise distribution of heat-transfer
coefficient decreased monotonically from this peakthe average heat-transfer coefficients over the
front half of the cylinder are in agreement with
previous data forcomparable reynolds number
rangethe theoretical heat-transfer distributions for
both laminar and turbulent boundary layers are
calculated directly from simple quadrature formulas
derived in the present report .similar solutions for the compressible boundary layer
heat-transfer and skin-friction
parameters obtained from exact
numerical solutions to the laminar
compressible-boundary-layer equations
for the infinite cylinder in yaw are
presentedthe chordwise flow in
the transformed plane is of the
falkner-skan typesolutions are given
for chordwise stagnation flow with
bothporous andnonporous wallthe effect oflinear viscositytemperature
relation is compared with
the effect of the sutherland viscositytemperature
relation at the stagnation
line of the cylinder forprandtl number of 0.7the effects of
pressure gradient, mach number, yaw
angle, and wall temperature are investigated
forlinear viscosity-temperature
relation andprandtl number
of 1.0 withnonporous wallthe results indicate that compressibility
effects become important
at large mach numbers and yaw angles,
with larger percentage effects on
the skin friction than on the heat
transferthe use of the two different
viscosity relations gives about the
same results except when large changes
in temperature occur across the boundary
layer, as forhighly cooled
wallthe present solutions predict thatlarger amount of coolant would
be required atgiven large mach number
and yaw angle than would be predicted
from solutions of the corresponding
incompressible-boundary-layer
equations .investigation of local heat transfer and pressure drag
local heat-transfer coefficients,
temperature recovery factors, and
pressure distributions were measured
oncircular cylinder atnominal
mach number of 3.9 overrange of
free-stream reynolds numbers from
fromto 44it was found that yawing the
cylinder reduced the local heat-transfer
coefficients, the average heat-transfer
coefficients, and the pressure
drag coefficients over the front side
of the cylinderfor example, at
is reduced by 34 percent and the
pressure drag by 60 percentthe
amount of reduction may be predicted bytheory presented hereinlocal
temperature recovery factors were also
reduced by yaw, but the amount of
reduction is small compared to the
reduction in heat-transfer coefficientsa comparison of these data with
other data obtained under widely
different conditions of body and stream
temperature, mach number, and
reynolds number indicates that these
factors have little effect upon the
dropoff of heat transfer due to yaw .aerodynamic characteristics ofcircular cylinder
pressure-distribution and force
tests ofcircular cylinder have
been made in the langley 11-inch
hypersonic tunnel atmach number of
based on diameter, and angles of
attack up to 90the results are
compared with the hypersonic approximation
of grimminger, williams, and
young and withsimple modification
of the newtonian flow theorythe
comparison of experimental results
shows that either theory gives adequate
general aerodynamic characteristics
but that the modified newtonian
theory givesmore accurate
prediction of the pressure distributionthe calculated crossflow drag
coefficients plotted asfunction
of crossflow mach number were found
to be in reasonable agreement with
similar results obtained from other
investigations at lower supersonic
mach numberscomparison of the
results of this investigation with
data obtained atlower mach number
indicates that the drag coefficient
ofcylinder normal to the flow is
relatively constant for mach numbers
above about.shock wave effects on the laminar skin friction of
an approximate theory on the phenomena of interaction between
the shock wave and the laminar boundary layer on an insulated
flat plate at hypersonic speeds has been formulatedresults
on the rate of growth of the boundary-layer thickness and
the rate of decay of the shock-wave strength have been found
that hold fora new set of formulas
for the average skin-friction coefficient, over an insulated
flat plate at hypersonic speeds has been obtainedcalculations
on the basis of the new formulas yield the data shown in figs.
steady decrease in as increases, the present results indicate
that may increase with at hypersonic mach numbers
.an experimental investigation of leading edge shock wave boundary layer
the boundary layer onslender body tends to be very thick at hypersonic
speedsit interacts with the external flow by producing larger
flow deflections near the leading edge than those due to the body alone
flow around the boundary layer gives rise to an induced pressure withnegative gradient which thins the boundary layer and increases the skin
friction with respect to the zero pressure gradient valueexperiments onflat plate withsharp leading edge have been performed
in the galcit 5-dash by 5-dash in. mach 5.8 hypersonic wind
tunnelthe induced pressure was measured by means of orifices in the
plate surfaceprofiles of mach number, velocity, mass flow, pressure,
and momentum deficiency were calculated from impact pressure surveys
normal to the plate surface made at various distances from the leading
edgethe results are as follows/1/ the induced pressures are 25 per cent
higher than the weak interaction theory/2/ the boundary layer and the
 external flow are distinctly separate for as low as 6,000/3/ the
shock wave location is in good agreement with that predicted by the
friedrichs theory forbody shape equivalent to the observed boundarylayer
displacement thickness/4/ expansion waves reflected from the
shock are weak/5/ the average skin-friction coefficient tends toward
and nearly matches the zero pressure gradient value downstream, but increases
to approximately twice that value as the leading edge is approached
.on the boundary layer equations in hypersonic flow
analytical solutions of the prandtl boundary-layer equations are obtained
for the problem of the /strong/ interaction between the leadingedge
shock and the viscous layer overflat plate at hypersonic
velocitiesas the mach number increases and the interaction region
spreads downstream over the plate, the local skin-friction coefficient
increases rapidly over its conventional valuethe local heat-transfer
coefficient at first remains practically unaffected but then also begins
to increase with mach number .heat transfer to flat plate in high temperature rarefied
an investigation was conducted inhypersonic
shock tunnel to determine the local heat transfer
rates forsharp leading edge flat platethe free
stream mach number range was 7.95 to 25.1 with
stagnation temperatures of approximately 2550
and 6500.  for these temperature and mach
number conditions, the strong interaction parameter,
varied from 2.35 to 826the
corresponding knudsen numbers, based on the
ratio of the free stream mean free path and the
leading edge thickness, varied from 0.38 to 85.5for free stream mach numbers greater than 10,
knudsen numbers of approximately unity, and
perfect gas conditions, the calculated heat transfer
coefficients were found to vary as as predicted
by the noninsulated flat plate theory of li
and nagamatsufor the case of,
the leading edge slip phenomenon drastically
reduced the local heat transfer coefficients
as compared to the theoretical values predicted
with no slip at the surfacefor the extreme case of and,
the measured local
heat transfer rate was an order of magnitude
less than the analytical valueboth the knudsen
number and the free stream mach number are
important physical parameters that determine the
extent of the slip-flow region .boundary layer displacement and leading edge bluntness effects in high
two important features of hypersonic flow over slender or thin bodies
are the displacement effect of the boundary layer and the large downstream
influence of leading-edge bluntnessthe present paper contributes
new theoretical and experimental results on this problemthe interaction of the two effects is treated theoretically by extending
 the basic shock-layer conceptin the outer inviscid flow,model
consisting ofdetached shock layer and an entropy layer is introduced
to account for bluntnessin the boundary layer, the approximate solution
is found to be governed bylocal flat-plate similarityunder
the assumption ofstrong bow shock andspecific heat ratio close to
unity,theory is developed for an arbitrary thin bodyfor flat-plate
 afterbodies, the theory yieldssolution agreeing with blast-wave
theory at one limit and strong-interaction theory at the otherwithin
the framework of the present theory, the problems involving angle of
attack are also analyzedcomplementary to the above study,hypersonic

hypersonic shock tunnel under cold-wall conditions, included measurement
 of surface heat-transfer distributions and schlieren studies for zero
and nonzero angle of attacksteady laminar heat-transfer rates were
measured by means of thin-film resistance thermometers at air test-flow
mach numbers around 12, free-stream reynolds numbers from 1.410 to 1.
for most of the experiments, airflow stagnation temperatures ranged from
ratios of about 0.15the range of test conditions at this stagnation
temperature encompassed the limiting cases of dominant bluntness and
dominant viscous-interaction effectsheat-transfer distributions were
also measured onsharp plate for air stagnation temperatures ranging
from 2,000degreek up to 4,000degreekthe experimental data are quite well correlated in terms of the foregoing
theoretical similitude variables characterizing combined effects
of boundary-layer displacement and bluntnessthe correlations obtained
 suggest that for the present experimental conditions, at least, the
hypersonic viscous similitude is valid even with leading-edge bluntness
 in the paper, is generally fair .viscous hypersonic similitudean extension of classical hypersonic similitude is developed
which takes into account the interaction effect of the displacement
thickness of the boundary layera basic result of this
viscous similitude is that the total drag including frictional drag
obeys the classical similarity law for the pressure dragadditional
similarity conditions governing viscous effects must be
imposed in this similitudeunderlying the similitude isnew hypersonic boundary-layer
independence principleaccording to this principle, the principal
part ofhypersonic boundary layer with given pressure
and wall temperature distributions and free-stream total enthalpy
is independent of the (high) external mach number distribution
outside the boundary layervarious features of viscous hypersonic similitudes are discussedit is found, for example, that it applies to three-dimensional
boundary-layer interaction effects on flat bodies, provided
the concepts of strip theory may be applied, and provided the
aspect ratio is an invariant .inviscid flow with nonequilibrium molecular dissociation for pressure
one-dimensional inviscid nonequilibrium flows oftwo-component model
gas are studied for prescribed pressure variations and an average reaction
rate based on recent data for oxygen recombinationthese flows
are interpreted in relation to the flow along streamlines around blunt
hypersonic bodiesassuming equilibrium conditions in the subsonic
region, it is estimated that the flow in the initial supersonic expansion
region, which is approximately of prandtl-meyer character, will be
chemically frozen with respect to the molecular dissociation of the
primary components under the hypersonic, high-altitude flight conditions
 consideredthe flight conditions consist of flight velocities between
furthermore, on bodies of small surface inclination beyond the nose, the
 flow will continue to be effectively frozen for at least 20 ft downstream
of the nosethese conclusions may lead to the simplification of
 procedures for theoretical calculation and testingthe problem of distinguishingdimensionless length-reaction rate parameter,
which characterizes the extent of departures from equilibrium or
 from frozen behavior in the flow fields of interest here, is discussedatomic recombination inhypersonic wind tunnel nozzlethe flow of an ideal dissociating gas throughnearly conical nozzle is
 consideredthe equations of one-dimensional motion are solved numerically
assumingsimple rate equation together withnumber of different
values for the rate constantthese calculations suggest that
deviations from chemical equilibrium will occur in the nozzle if the
rate constant lies withinvery wide range of values, and that, once
suchdeviation has begun, the gas will very rapidly 'freeze'the
dissociation fraction will then remain almost constant if the flow is
expanded further, or even if it passes throughconstant area sectionan approximate method of solution, making use of this property of sudden
'freezing' of the flow, has been developed and applied to the problem
of estimating the deviations from equilibrium underwide range of
 conditionsif all the assumptions made in this paper are accepted,
then lack of chemical equilibrium may be expected in the working sections
of hypersonic wind tunnels and shock tubesthe shape of an
optimum nozzle is derived in order to minimize this departure from
equilibriumit is shown that, while the test section conditions are greatly affected
 by 'freezing', the flow behindnormal shock wave is only changed
slightlythe heat transfer rate and drag ofblunt body are estimated
 to be reduced by only about 25 per cent even if complete freezing
occurshowever, the shock wave shape is shown to be rather more sensitive
to departures from equilibrium .viscous and inviscid stagnation flow indissociated hypervelocity free
high reynolds number hypersonic stagnation flow overblunt-nosed body
innonequilibrium dissociated free stream is analyzed and compared tosimilar flow in an initially undissociated ambient gasfree stream
dissociation effects on various equilibrium stagnation flow properties
in air are presented asfunction of the ambient atom mass fraction and
 dissociation energy for velocities ranging from 15,000 to 25,000 fpssignificant changes in the bow shock geometry, stagnation gas state, and
 boundary layer behavior are found when the free stream dissociation
involves more than 10( of the total energyit is observed that for
large amounts of both atomic oxygen and nitrogen ahead of the body, the
equilibrium shock layer properties converge toward those pertaining to
chemically and vibrationally-frozen flow across the bow shockmoreover,
under certain conditions, the ionization level can be increased by
 an order of magnitude and the usual reduction in frozen boundary layer
heat transfer due tohighly-cooled noncatalytic surface can increase
from stall of adjacent stagesthe effects of compromises of stage matching to favor part-speed operation
were also consideredthis phase of the study indicated that
such compromises would severely reduce the complete-compressor-stall
marginfurthermore, the low-speed stage stall problem is transferred
from the inlet stages to the middle stages, which are more susceptible
to abrupt-stall characteristicsthe analysis indicates that inlet stages having continuous performance
characteristics at their stall points are desirable with respect to
part-speed compressor performancethese characteristics must, however,
 be obtained when the stages are operating in the flow environment of
the multistage compressoralleviation of part-speed operational problems
may also be obtained by improvement in either stage flow range or
stage loading marginthe results of this analysis are only qualitativethe trends obtained,
 however, are in agreement with those obtained from experimental studies
 of high-pressure-ratio multistage axial-flow compressors, and the results
are valuable in developing an understanding of the off-design
problemin addition to these stage-matching studies,general discussion
of variable-geometry features such as air bleed and adjustable
 gas modelnumerical solutions of non-equilibrium airflows with fully
coupled chemistry providepreliminary verification of such scaling for
limit characteristicsthe analysis indicated that all these problems
could be attributed to discontinuities in the performance characteristics
of the front stagessuch discontinuities can be due to the type
 of stage stall or todeterioration of stage performance resulting

phenomena were introduced by the writer in some previous workthe present paper develops further one particular aspect of the
method,--i.e., the elimination of /ignorable coordinates ./  this
is accomplished byspecial choice of generalized coordinates,
each of which is constituted by an arbitrary temperature distribution
and an /associated flow field ./  the latter isvector
field which is derived from the corresponding scalar field byvariational
methodthe procedure is valid forcertain class of nonlinear
problems, provided we replace the temperature by the heat
content as the unknownit is shown that for normal coordinates
derivation of the associated flow field is immediatethe use
of normal coordinates and their associated flow fields is illustrated
by an exampleintroduction of dirac functions and
associated flow fields yieldsprocedure which constitutesgeneralization of the classical formulation by green's functions
and integral equationsthis is illustrated by application to onedimensional
problems of heating ofhomogeneous or composite
slab and directly verified by classical methods in the appendix .new thermo-mechanical reciprocity relations with application
based on the variational formulation of linear thermodynamics
as developed previously by the writer, thermomechanical
reciprocity relations are discussed which lead to new methods of
analysis of thermal stressesthese reciprocity relations are quite
different from the usual ones derived from the analogy of thermal
loading withcombination of surface and body-force distributionthe results are applicable to stationary and transient temperatures
in elastic and viscoelastic structuresthe methods are
entirely variational and do not require the evaluation of the
temperature fieldthe stresses at one point are expressed directly
in terms of any arbitrary distribution temperatures applied
externally, including the effect of surface heat-transfer layerthe concepts and procedures are illustrated onsimple examplethe relation is pointed out between the reciprocity
property and the generalization of castigliano's principle to
thermomechanics .approximate formulas for thermal-stress analysisthe basis of any thermal-stress analysis is the determination of the
temperature distributions in the structurefor arbitrary flight
histories, the determination of such distributions is rather tedious
and not completely generalthis latter fact handicaps optimization
studies in the project design stage when it is desirable to be able to
express the thermal-stress distributions ingeneral mannerin this note, general expressions are derived for the thermal-stress
distributions intypical i-section using similar assumptions to
those of biot .the melting of finite slabsan approximate method, known as the
heat-balance integral, is used to determine the
melting rate offinite slab which is initially
atuniform temperature below the melting
pointthe slab is acted upon byconstant heat input at one face and has its other
face either insulated or kept at its initial
temperaturethe first three terms of series
solutions in an intrinsically small parameter
are obtained for the time histories of
melting and the temperature distribution in the slab .influence coefficients for real gasesin the analysis of one-dimensional fluid-flow problems, it is often
assumed that the behavior of the medium is that ofperfect gasthis assumption is justified, provided the pressure and temperature
range of interest is small and near atmosphericat higher pressures
and temperatures various deviations are introduced thereby causing
deviations from the results obtained by using the ideal fluid-flow
equationsin this note, influence coefficients, similar to those developed by
shapiro, are presented for the case of real gasesthis analysis is
based upon the use of various functions of the compressibility factor
emmonssome of the assumptions made were as follows..  (1) the flow
is one-dimensional and steady, (2) changes in the stream properties
are continuous, and (3) the flow is comprised of imperfect gasesconduction of heat insolid withpower law of heat
the nonlinear boundary value problem, where
andare constants, is solved formally by first
introducing power series infor the unknown temperature

the special cases and generalizations of

applies, are notedsurface temperatures are also found by
methods of difference equations, whereis not limited to
small valuesgraphs of these temperatures corresponding
to various laws of heat transfer at the surface are shown .nonlinear heat transfer problema study has been made of the time-dependent heat

purposes is presentedas an example, the problem
of the time-dependent surface temperature ofbody

is treatedthe analysis is also applicable to physical
adsorption or chemisorption processes which occur at
the boundary .an approximate treatment of unsteady heat conduction
this very short paper presents an approximate procedure for the
calculation of unsteady heat conduction in semi-infinite solids
with variable thermal propertiesit is claimed to be an improvement
over previous efforts in this area since it yields physically
sensible results for cases where thermal properties havelarge
dependence on temperatureinstead of using polynomials to represent
an unsteady temperature profile an exponential form is usedgood agreement is shown for several cases where the method of
the paper is compared with exact solutions .variational analysis of ablationthe variational and lagrangian thermodynamics developed in earlier
publications are directly applicable to problems of heat conduction
with melting boundariesthese techniques are used here in treating
the problem ofhalf-space subjected toconstant rate of heat input
at the melting surface (fig. 1)the applicability of the lagrangian equations to this case follows
from the fact that the basic variational principle is valid whether the
boundaries are fixed or move as arbitrary functions of timethis
can be seen if we remember that the equations govern only the instantaneous
configuration of the flow rates forgiven geometry and
temperature field .compressor operation with one or more blade rows stalledan analysis of the part-speed operating problems of high-pressure-ratio
ratio multistage axial-flow compressors was made by means ofsimplified stage-stacking studythe principal problems considered
were poor low-speed efficiency, multiple-valued performance characteristics
at intermediate speeds, and poor intermediate-speed compressor
surge or stall-limit characteristicsthe analysis indicated that all
these problems could be attributed to discontinuities in the performance
characteristics of the front stagessuch discontinuities can be due
to the type of stage stall or todeterioration of stage performance
resulting from stall of adjacent stagesthe effects of compromises of stage matching to favor part-speed operation
were also consideredthis phase of the study indicated that such
compromises would severly reduce the complete-compressor-stall marginfurthermore, the low-speed stage stall problem is transferred from the
inlet stages to the middle stages, which are more susceptible to
abrupt-stall characteristicsthe analysis indicates that inlet stages having continuous performance
characteristics at their stall points are desirable with respect to
part-speed compressor performancethese characteristics must, however,
be obtained when the stages are operating in the flow environment of the
multistage compressoralleviation of part-speed operation problems may
also be obtained by improvement in either stage flow range or stage-loading
marginthe results of this analysis are only qualitativethe trends obtained,
however, are in agreement with those obtained from experimental
studies of high-pressure-ratio multistage axial-flow compressors, and
the results are valuable in developing an understanding of the off-design
problemin addition to these stage-matching studies,general
discussion of variable-geometry features such as air bleed and adjustable
blades is included .some stall and surge phenomena in axial flow compressorsobservations of rotating stall have shown thatwide variety
of stall patterns is possiblehot-wire anemometer data onmultistage compressor have
shownprogressive-type stall at low speedsthe amplitude
of the flow fluctuations increases in magnitude through the first
few stages and then diminishes rapidly tosmall value in the
latter stagesa stage-stacking analysis has shown that rotating
stall will exist overlarge portion of the compressor map at low
speeds but will be instigated almost simultaneously with compressor
surge at high speedsblades failures attributable to resonant vibrations excited by
rotating stall have been experienced in single  and multistage
compressorsin the stage-stacking analysis no deterioration of stage performance
due to unsteady flow resulting from stall of adjacent stages
was consideredin general, the pressure drop at the stall point
is believed to be much larger than indicated by an analytical formulation
of compressor performancecompressor surge is attributed
tolimit cycle operation about the compressor stall
point, and, as indicated infew compressor tests and in jet-engine
tests,small compressor discharge receiver volume may
result simply in stall of the compressor without the cyclic characteristics
of compressor surgein this event, engine operation
will be limited because of the large drop in performance which
accompanies compressor stall  .effects of stage characteristics and matching on axial flow compressor

test experiencefactors governing major performance parameters are
discussed and certain development problems and possible solutions are
reviewed .an approximate equation for the /choke line/ ofcompressordiscussion ofsimilarity between the pressure-ratio versus inletmass-flow-coefficient

extended tocompressor andcompression nozzle, and an approximate
expression for the /choke line/ of the compressor is developed .design of axial compressorsthe main types of axial compressors are described, and the use of generalized
design curves to make performance estimates is advocatedthe
different variables are weight, power, pressure ratio, temperature rise,
 mass flow, rotational speed, stage efficiency, blade bending stresses
due to aerodynamic loading, and methods and materials of constructionair outlets, flow coefficients and different blade forms are also considered
.theoretical considerations of flutter at high mach

which may be applied in flutter calculations at high mach numbers
are discussedthese include linear theory, van dyke's
second-order theory, piston theory, landahl's method, tangentwedge
and tangent-cone approximations, newtonian theory, andnew nonlinear-pressure methoda comparison of the theories
is made by showing the results of flutter calculations for mach
numbers up to 10, and the possibility of flutter at these higher
mach numbers is pointed outresults of flutter calculations are shown to illustrate the various
effects arising fromnonlinear thickness theorythe possibility
of large flutter speed thickness effects which depend on frequency
ratio is shownthe influence of airfoil shape is discussed
and flutter speed trends with center of gravity and elastic axis
locations are presentedsome possible refinements of piston
theory are discussed for use at very high mach numbersthese
include the use of local flow conditions and the use of newtonian
theory over the leading edge ofblunt-nosed airfoil .wind tunnel techniques for the measurements of oscillatory derivatives
this paper discusses the basic principles employed in techniques for the
 measurement of oscillatory derivatives in wind tunnels, and gives some
account of the associated instrumentationthe suitability of the various
techniques for different test conditions is also discussed and
brief reference is made to wind tunnel effects on the measurements .the equilibrium piston technique for gun tunnel operationa modified technique for the operation ofgun tunnel is
suggested based on experimental resultsif the piston mass and the
initial barrel pressure are chosen correctly, then the peak pressures
associated with the gun tunnel may be eliminatedunder these
conditions the piston is brought to rest with no overswingsome
measurements of the piston motion usingmicrowave technique are
reported which confirm this ideathe wave diagram associated with this mode of operation is
shown, and some calculations of the stagnation pressure are given which
show that during the suggested running time, the stagnation pressure
may be considerably greater than the driving pressure if the driving
chamber cross-sectional area is large compared with that of the driven
sectionforuniform shock tube the stagnation pressure will always
be less than the driving pressurethe use of air, helium and
hydrogen as driving gases has been consideredexperiments ingun tunnel are reported which show that the
equilibrium piston technique enables steady stagnation pressures to be
achieved overtime of approximately 15 ms using air as the driving
gasthe expansion caused by the piston acceleration is shown to
interact with the stationary piston, but this is found to produce onlysmall drop in stagnation pressure .the properties of crossed flexure pivots, and the influence of the
it is shown that the rotational stiffness ofcrossed flexure pivot
varies considerably when subjected to an applied forcethe type of
variation can be radically changed simply by moving the point at which
the strips crossthe relation between torque and rotation forgiven
applied force is not exactly linear and the extent of the non-linearity
is determined by taking into account the small movements of the centre
of rotation of the pivotfinally, for design purposes, an analysis of
the maximum stresses in the strips is given .measurements of pitching moment derivatives for blunt-nose aerofoils
direct pitching moment derivatives have been measured using the method
of scruton, woodgate et al for two single wedge blunt-nosed aerofoilsthese measurements were made at mach numbers of 1.75 and 2.47 and frequency
parameters less than 0.02in general, nose blunting was found
to have little effect on the derivatives although changes were observed
for the thinner wedge atmach number of 1.75 .new test techniques forhypervelocity wind tunnelthe measurement of rocket exhaust effects on vehicle stability and the
measurement of aerodynamic damping were made in an arc-discharge type of
 hypervelocity wind tunnelsample data are given to indicate the
quality of data obtainable in this tunnel, and samples of self-luminous
and shadowgraph photographs are also presented .aerodynamic forces, moments and stability derivatives
the problem of determining the total
forces, moments, and stability
derivatives forslender body performing
slow maneuvers incompressible
fluid is treated within the assumptions
of slender-body theorygeneral
expressions for the total forces (except
drag) and moments are developed
in terms of the geometry and motions of
the airplane, and formulas for
the stability derivatives are derived in
terms of the mapping functions
of the cross sectionsall components of the motion are
treated simultaneously and second
derivatives as well as first are obtained,
with respect to both the
motion components and their time rates of
changecoupling of the longitudinal
and lateral motions is thus
automatically includeda number of
general relationships among the various
stability derivatives are found
which are independent of the configuration,
so that, at most, only 35
oftotal of 325 first and second
derivatives need be calculated
directlycalculations of stability
derivatives are carried out for two
triangular wings with camber and thickness,
one withblunt trailing
edge, and for two wing-body combinations, one havingplane wing and
vertical finthe influence on the stability
derivatives of the squared terms in
the pressure relation is demonstrated,
and the apparent mass concept as
applied to slender-body theory is discussed
at some length in the light
of the present analysisit is shown that
the stability derivatives can
be calculated by apparent mass although the
general expressions for the
total forces and moments involve additional terms .the calculation of lateral stability derivatives of
comparisons are made between
low-speed experimental results and
estimates based on attached-flow
theory for the lateral stability
derivatives of slender wings at
incidence, and it is found that the flow
separation has little effect on
the sideslip derivativesthe reduction
in due to part-span anhedral
is evaluated, andsemi-empirical formula
is derived to account for important
second-order termsfor the rotary
derivatives, an attempt is made
to estimate the effect of the leading edge
vortices, but no satisfactory
conclusions have been reachedthe fin contributions to
the derivatives are evaluated on the basis
of treating the wing surface astotal reflection plategood agreement
with experiment is reached for
the sideslip derivatives, and for the
damping-in-yaw at moderate incidencessidewash is found to havelarge
effect on the rolling derivatives,
and further information on the strength
and position of the leading edge
vortices in non-symmetric flow is required
beforecomplete calculation of
the sidewash can be given .calculation of the flow past slender delta wings with
the flow pastslender delta
wing withsharp leading edge, at
incidence, usually separates along
this edge, i.e.vortex layer extends
from the edge and rolls up to form/core/ (a region of high vorticity)a potential flow model of this is
constructed in which the layer is
replaced byvortex sheet which
is rolled up intospiral in the region
of the /core/this problem
is reduced totwo-dimensional one by assumingconical field and using
slender wing theorythe shape and strength
of the sheet are determined by
the two conditions that it isstream
surface and sustains no pressure
differenceuse is made of results
previously obtained for the core
region and the remaining finite part of
the sheet is dealt with by choosing
certain functions for its shape and
strengththe parameters in these
functions are found by satisfying the
two conditions stated above at
isolated pointsresults are obtained for
the pressure distribution, chord
loading and norman force coefficient as
functions of the ratio of the
incidence to the apex anglethe lift forgiven incidence is about 15

this is the first of three parts of
the calibration report on the r.a.e.some details of the design and lay-out
of the plant are given, together
with the calculated performance figures,
and the major components of the
facility are briefly describedthe instrumentation provided for
the wind-tunnel is described in some
detail, including the optical and other
methods of flow visualization used
in the tunnellater parts will describe the
calibration of the flow in the workingsection,
including temperature measurementsa discussion of the heater
performance will also be included as
well as the results of tests to determine
starting and running pressure ratios,
blockage effects, model starting loads,
and humidity of the air flow .thein.7 in. hypersonic wind tunnel at r.a.e. farnborough
tests on the storage heater, which is cylindrical in form and mounted
horizontally, show that its performance is adequate for operation
at m=6.8 and probably adequate for flows at m=8.2 with the existing
nozzlesin its present state, the maximum design temperature of 680
degrees centigrade for operation at m=9 cannot be realised in the tunnel
because of heat loss to the outlet attachments of the heater and quickacting
valve which form, in effect,large heat sinkbecause of this
heat loss there is rather poor response of stagnation temperature
in the working section at the start ofrunit is hoped to cure this
by preheating the heater outlet cone and the quick-acting valveat pressures greater than about 100 p.s.i.g. free convection through the
fibrous thermal insulation surrounding the heated core causes the top
of the heater shell to become somewhat hotter than the bottom, which
results in /hogging/ distortion of the shellthis free convection
cools the heater core andvertical temperature gradient is set up
across it after onlyfew minutes at high pressuremodifications to be incorporated in the heater to improve its performance
are described .thein.7 in. hypersonic wind tunnel at r.a.e., farnborough

wind tunnel producesflow field with an average mach number of 6.85
along the centreline of the working sectionthe mach number gradually
decreases towards the boundary layer, and overcore of approximately
mach numberthe nozzle heats up duringrun but this has little effect on the
mach number distributionat one station the mach number was one-third
per cent greater forrun ofminute than forrun of 10 secondsthe temperature field in the inviscid flow has an average variation of

pressure measurements were made onslender cone-cylinder-flare configuration,
slightly blunted at the nose, for 0,anddegrees incidence
atfree-stream mach number of 6.8it was found that the surface pressures obtained on the cone agreed with
 extrapolations toequals 6.8 of theoretical values given in m.i.t.
tables /kopal/for yawed cones, and that impact theory gavegood indication
of the pressure level to be expected on all parts of the body
where surface incidence was sufficiently large to merit its usethe semi-angles of the conical and flared parts of the model were both
the pressure level on the flare rose in all cases to approximately that
developed upstream on the cone surfaceno evidence ofmarked over-expansion to pressures below the freestream
value was noticed at the junction between cone and cylinder .formulae and approximations for aerodynamic heating rates in high speed
this note gives formulae and approximations suitable for making preliminary
estimates of aerodynamic heating rates in high speed flightthe formulae are based on the /intermediate enthalpy/ approximation
which has given good agreement with theoretical and experimental evidencein the general flight case they could be used in conjunction with
 an analogue computer orstep-by-step method of integration to predict
the variations of heat flow and skin temperature with timein the restricted case of flight at constant altitude and mach number,
simple analytical methods and results are given which include the effects
of radiation and can be applied to /thick/ as well as /thin/ skins
whereis the aerodynamic heat transfer factor, and g,andare the
heat capacity, thickness and thermal conductivity of the skinif 0.1
the skin is approximately /thin/, i.e. temperature gradients across its
thickness may be neglected .duct flow in magnetohydrodynamicsthis paper is an extension of the work of hartmann (2) and shercliff
transverse magnetic fields -- the simplest class of magnetohydrodynamic
problemswe are concerned here mainly with the boundary value
problems associated with flow in ducts with conducting walls .aerodynamic noise in supersonic wind tunnelshot-wire measurements in the free stream ofsupersonic wind tunnel
were made in the mach number range of 1.6 to 5.0it is shown that the
mass-flow fluctuations increase very rapidly with increasing mach numberif the fluctuation field is assumed to consist of sound waves-dash
an assumption that is consistent with the measurements-dashthe sound
intensity is approximately proportional to m, within the range of the
experimentsfurthermore, the orientation of the field is found to be
different from the mach line direction,. it corresponds tosoundsource
velocity of approximately one-half the free-stream velocity for
the higher mach numbersit is shown that the turbulent boundary layer
along the nozzle and the tunnel walls is responsible for this sound
field .on three dimensional bodies of delta planform which
this note collects together in one report available theoretical work
on bodies which can support attached plane shock waves, discusses some
of the possible merits of such shapes, and includes some calculations
illustrating their propertiesalso, some preliminary results from
wind tunnel tests are given, together with details of proposed future
tests .corner interference effectsthe three-dimensional incompressible flow of fluid along the corner of
two semi-infinite plates intersecting at right angles, especially the
interference of the boundary layers of the two plates, is discussedmainly, the more important case of turbulent boundary layer is treated
by means of experimental studies carried out at the technical university
of braunschweigsome theoretical results for laminar flow are also
taken into accountin order to describe the interference effects in the boundary layer,
an interference displacement thickness and an interference skin friction
have been introducedit is shown from experiments and also from theoretical
considerations how these two quantities depend on reynolds
numberfurthermore, the influence of interference on the transition
from laminar to turbulent flow is investigatedin addition, some
preliminary results are given about the effect of the pressure gradient
on the interference effects .an approximate solution of the compressible laminar
followingmajor assumption that enthalpy and velocity are dependent
only on local conditions, an enthalpy-velocity relation
is obtained for the laminar boundary layer onflat plate where subscriptsrefer to the plate,to the free stream andto the
equilibrium temperature condition at the platewhen compared with
general results, this relation (exact for prandtl number= 1)
givesclose approximation to crocco's numerical results for= 0.725
and 1.25, up tousing the above relation in conjunction with the approximate
viscosity-temperature relation suggested by chapman and rubesin, and
with young's suggested first approximation for shearing stress it is
shown that close approximations to displacement thickness and velocity
distribution are given by and where and which serves to define.these have the advantage of being algebraic in form whereas previous
results have involved complex numerical integrations for individual
cases .pressure distributions and flow patterns at m=4on
wind tunnel tests have been made
to measure pressure distributions
and to study flow patterns onseries
of delta wings of inverted 'v'
cross-sectioneach of these wings
was designed to haveplane shock
wave in the plane of the leading edges
atchosen mach number and incidenceit was found that forwide
incidence range about the design point
the shock wave remained virtually
attached to the leading edges and at
each incidence the pressure was
approximately constant over the lower
surface .the contraction of satellite orbits under the influence of air drag
the effect of air drag on satellite orbits of small eccentricity e/0.2/
is studied analytically byperturbation method, on the assumption that
 the atmosphere is spherically symmetricalequations are derived which
 show/1/how orbital period and perigee distance vary with eccentricity
as the orbit contracts, and/2/how each of these quantities varies with
timethe equations of type/1/are nearly independent of the oblateness
of the atmospherein all the equations, terms of orderand higher
are usually neglectedthe results are also presented graphically, inmanner designed for practical usethe theory is to be extended to an oblate atmosphere in part ii, and
will later be compared with observation .the contraction of satellite orbits under the influence of air dragpart iiwith oblate atmospherethe effect of air drag on satellite orbits of small eccentricity e/0.2/
was studied in part i/technical note no.g.w.533/on the assumption that
the atmosphere was spherically symmetricalhere the theory is extended
 to an atmosphere in which the surfaces of constant density are
spheroids of arbitrary small ellipticityequations are derived which
show how perigee distance and orbital period vary with eccentricity, and
 how eccentricity is related to timeexpressions are also obtained
which give lifetime and air density at perigee in terms of the rate of
change of periodin most of the equations, terms of orderand higher
 are neglectedthe results take different forms according as the
eccentricity is greater or less than about 0.025, while circular orbits
are dealt with inseparate sectionthe results are also presented
graphically inmanner designed for practical application, and examples
 of the theory in use are giventhe influence of atmospheric oblateness is difficult to summarize fairly

and 5-10( would bemore representative figure .the contraction of satellite orbits under the influence of air dragthe effect of air drag on satellite orbits of eccentricityless than
between 0.2 andis presentedequations are derived which show how
perigee distance and orbital period vary with eccentricity during the
satellite's life, and how eccentricity is related to time,.and formulae
are obtained for the lifetime and the air density at perigee, in terms
of the rate of change of periodthe results are also presented
graphically and their implications and limitations are discussed .determination of upper-atmosphere air density and scale height fromsolution is obtained for the rate of change of semi-major axis and
perigee distance ofsatellite orbit with time due to the resistance of
 the atmospherethe logarithm of air density is assumed to vary quadratically
with height, and the oblateness of the atmosphere is taken
into accountthe calculation of perigee air density in terms of the rate of change
of satellite period is dealt with,. and the method is applied to data
at present available on six different satellitesthe variation of air
density with height is obtained as

the theory previously developed for the changes in the perigee distance
and semi-major axis ofsatellite orbit due to air drag is extended to
enable the air-density profile/i.e.its relative variation with height/to
 be derived from the motion of the orbit's perigeethe solution is
first obtained in terms of the change in perigee distance and then in
terms of the change in the radius of the earth at the sub-perigee point

 is investigated through variation of parameters and through use of an
atmospheric model involvingpower function between density and
altitudethis model is shown to fit actual conditions better than an
exponential functionthe effects of the equatorial belt and the rotation of the earth are
investigatedthe conclusion is reached that through these anomalies
atmospheric drag substantially affects the orbit elements, especially
those defining the orbit planean alternate approach of variation of parameters is presented, by whichdirect relation between period decay and instantaneous density conditions
is establishedthis approach, by itself specifically adequate
for prediction work, also opens an avenue for systematic and unified
evaluation of observed decay .density of the upper atmosphere from analysis of satellite orbits ..

 supposition thathad low values, near 35 km, at heights near 250 km,

improved in accuracy if more accurate orbits were available for shortlifetime
satellites .on the coupling between heat and mass transferin mixtures of two different gases or liquids, one constituent
will migrate spontaneously toward the warmer parts, and
the other toward the colder partsthis phenomenon, known
as the soret effect, and its converse the dufour effect, were
discovered as early as 1856 and 1873 respectivelythe two
effects can also be considered assimultaneous transport of
mass and heat, or ascoupling between heat and mass transferthe effects of this coupling have been neglected in all investigations
of heat transfer in multicomponent flow systems so far,
on thepriori assumption that they are smallinrecent
publication however, it was shown that they can be large in
laminar-boundary-layer-type flows with helium injectionturbulent-boundary-layer
measurements and an analysis conducted
at the heat transfer laboratory clearly showed significant
effects of the coupling on heat transfer and adiabatic wall temperaturefrom additional measurements, the results of which
are presented below, it is possible to separate the heat flux at the
model wall into one part depending on the temperature gradient
andsecond part caused by the couplingit is shown that
the latter exceeds the former, and hence the coupling may not
be neglectedpriori without careful consideration .cruise performance of channel-flow ground effect machinesthe performance theory for high-speed air-cushion vehicles
operating in close proximity to the ground is developedthe
analysis is restricted to cruise flight of vehicles of rectangular
planform employing an air pressure seal between the ground and
the vehicle along the two streamwise sidesthe variation of
the optimum rearward deflection angle of the side jet pressure
seal with speed for minimum overall power expenditure and
maximum range is foundit is concluded thatmixed propulsion
system (jet deflection plus propeller(s)) is requiredvolume flow and the corresponding fan pressure rise needed are
also calculatedthe maximum lift drag ratio is determinedthe maximum thickness ratios of the vehicles are considered
to be large compared with the ground-height vehicle-length
ratiotwo-dimensional airfoil theory is employed to show that
close to stagnation conditions exist below the vehiclesthe
lower-surface lift, pitching moment, and aerodynamic-center
location are determinedthe flow over the upper surface is identified with flow over
moundsupper-surface lift coefficients are determined for
typical mound shapesit is shown that high total lift coefficients are theoretically
obtainable with almost zero induced dragthe conventional
induced-drag power penalty is replaced bysealing-air power
expenditure, which is shown not to be excessive .viscous and inviscid nonequilibrium gas flowsthe condition of immediate freezing of the mass fraction of
dissociated species of air at the equilibrium value behind the
shock envelope prevails overmajor portion of the flight spectrum
associated with lifting re-entry vehiclesthis is observed
by means of order-of-magnitude considerations within the limits
of the present knowledge of chemical reaction rates for the constituents
of airaccordingly, investigations of the viscous and
inviscid hypersonic flow about blunt and sharp leading edge
slender bodies are madethe investigations are generalized to
consider an arbitrary degree of dissociation in the ambient free
streamthis condition is included in order to allow comparison
with the flow field aboutmodel in the test section ofhypersonic
facility with dissociated air species present in the free
streaminviscid frozen flow investigations are made for blunt and
sharp leading edge slender body power-law geometriesthe
results indicate that the influence offinite leading edge, in
inducingpressure field far downstream (/blast-wave/ analogy),
is considerably diminished for this modelthis conclusion is
verified numerically bycharacteristics solution for the hypersonic
flow about/sonic-wedge/ slabthe viscous investigations consider the boundary-layer
interaction problem withfrozen degree of dissociationin
this case, as in the inviscid analysis, the governing parameter is
observed to be the ratio of the dissociation
energy to the free-stream kinetic energythe influence
of this parameter on the boundary-layer interaction
mechanism forhighly cooled, noncatalytic wall is presentedthe influence offrozen flow field on skin friction and heat
transfer is also discussedfinally, since higher mach number gas flows may be generated
in wind tunnel nozzles where dissociation nonequilibrium effects
are present, the possibility of employing expansions withcontrolled degree of dissociation astechnique for aerodynamic
simulation is presented .some features of supersonic and hypersonic flow about
forfamily of cones of various semiapex angles blunted by
spherical caps, shock shapes and surface pressure distributions
have been obtained from both the belotserkovskii method and
experimentthese results are used to study convergence to
conical flowconditions leading to both overexpansion and
underexpansion on the surface with respect to the asymptotic
conical pressures are described as well as conditions leading to
bow shock inflection pointsconditions also exist for whichsecond shock may occur, or for which the sonic line cannot touch
the body surfacethe implications of these conditions for
various blunt-body methods are discussedfor cones blunted
in suchmanner as to keep the flow entirely supersonic, the flow
field is found to exhibit certain similarities with that for genuine
bluntingthis is related to the fact that the surface entropy
layer for blunt bodies can be most influential, in determining surface
pressure, in the interior of the flow field rather than near
the surface .flutter analysis of circular panelsthe flutter problem of flat circular panels with edges elastically
restrained against rotation has been formulated in terms of smalldeflection
plate theorythe panel is subjected to uniform allround
tension or compression in its middle plane, in addition to
the supersonic compressible flow passing over its upper surface
with still air belowlinear piston theory is employed to predict
the aerodynamic load on the vibrating panelthe problem is investigated byrayleigh-type analysis involving
chosen modes of the panel as degrees of freedomin order to investigate the convergence of the solution, the
flutter-mode shape of the clamped-edge panel has been expressed
inseries form in powers ofcos.  the results of three-, four-,
and five-term approximations have displayed oscillatory behavior
with apparently rapid convergence of the solution .thermal effects ontranspiration cooled hemispherean approximate method is used to obtain the injection
distribution which would exist on an isothermal,
transpiration-cooled hemisphere insupersonic streamthis distribution is the same for both air and helium
injection, and is independent of the blowing levela
model having this distribution was tested in the naval
supersonic laboratory wind tunnel atmach number
of 3.53it is concluded that the design technique is
reasonably accuratedata taken near the nose are
compared with the theories for air and helium injectionthe agreement in the case of the reduction in
heat-transfer coefficient is goodthe values of insulated
wall temperature obtained near the nose with
helium injection arepercent above the local stagnation
temperature, and largely independent of injection
rateit is believed that this phenomenon may be
attributed to the thermal diffusion of the helium within
the boundary layerair injection causesslight reduction
in the insulated wall temperatureit is shown
that injection of either air or helium at the hemisphere
nose considerably reduces the heat flux at the surfacethe additional reduction in heat flux resulting from
helium injection as opposed to air injection, and predicted
by existing theory, is largely absent .second-order effects in laminar boundary layerssecond-order boundary layer disturbances are
due to the displacement of the main flow by

cylinder and for the hypersonic axisymmetric
stagnation pointfor the latter flow, the dominant
effect is that of vorticity, which increases
both shear and heat fluxfor the plate or cylinder,
the same conclusion tends to hold for high

is applicable for any arbitrary time-dependent motion and can be
utilized for flexible as well as rigid wingsthe approach involves
the derivation of an integral equation relating the unknown pressure

lecture as it seems to be the most promising one available at the
momentit must be emphasized, however, that although some
progress has been made in dicsovering the behaviour ofstructure subjected to noise it is not possible to estimate the life
of any component at the drawing board stagesome prototype
strain measurements and proof testing are therefore essential if
one is to prove the integrity of the designwithin the structural limits of single skin construction set in
this lecture the main conclusion to be reached is that no reasonable
estimate of fatigue life can yet be made in the drawing
board stage ofstructurenevertheless,study of the form of
behaviour of typical structures has led totheoretical simplification
of the problem of skin vibrationfrom this it has been
possible to suggest an optimum deisgn forskin stiffened by
stringersa suggestion for an optimum design of skin and rib
for control surfaces to minimise stresses at the rib-skin intersection
is put forward but no experience can check this yetthe most resonable basis for the future estimation of
fatigue life ofcomponent appears to be the /random/ s-n

necessary test datathe life expectation ofnew design will be uncertain and
some proof testing is essential if the integrity of structure in high

the clamped plate problem in
the classical theory for the small

of discrepancies with analytic considerationsspecifically,
measured recovery temperatures are appreciably higher than those
predicted ,. while heat transfer coefficients are satisfactorily reproducedit is shown on the basis of both approximate and exact
solutions for plates and stagnation points that the discrepancies in
previous results are related to thermal diffusion effects,major
influence being apparent in application of the surface boundary

local heat-transfer coefficients and recovery factors are presented
for separated and reattached turbulent flows as obtained
bydownward step in an otherwise flat surface intwo-dimensional,
subsonic, air flowthe region downstream of the step,
the focus of this investigation, containedregion of separated
flow with reattachment at about five step heights downstream,
followed bysection of reattached flowthe salient feature of
the results is the maximum in the local heat-transfer coefficient
at the reattachment point, with values thereof diminishing in the
separated region and also in the reattached region, where they
tend toward values characteristic of turbulent boundary-layer
flowit is found that for most of the region the heat-transfer
coefficient depends on the velocity to about the 0.8 power, thoughdecreased dependence may exist in the separated regionrecovery
factors have the characteristically low values associated
with separated flows, and do not attain values typical of turbulent

boundary-layer displacement and leading-edge bluntness on surfaces in
hypersonic flowthe presence of the boundary layer and the blunt
leading edge induce pressure gradients which in turn affect the skin

recent three-dimensional results is presented .departure from dissociation equilibrium inhypersonic nozzlethe equations of motion for the flow of an ideal dissociating gas
throughnearly conical nozzle have been solved numerically, assumingsimple equation for the rate of dissociation, andnumber of
different values of the rate constantthe results of these
calculations suggest that deviations from dissociation equilibrium will
occur in the nozzle if the rate constant lies withinvery wide range
of valuesthey also suggest that once suchdeviation has begun the
gas will very rapidly/freeze/, so that the dissociation fraction will
remain almost constant if the flow is expanded further, or even if it
passes throughconstant area test sectionan approximate method
of solution, making use of this property of sudden/freezing/of the flow,
 has been developed and applied to the problem of estimating the
deviations from equilibrium underwide range of conditionsif all
the assumptions made in this report are accepted, then lack of
dissociation equilibrium may be expected in the working sections of
hypersonic wind tunnels and hypersonic shock tubesit is shown, however, that the flow behindnormal shock wave in suchwind tunnel will not be greatly affected by any freezing that may take
place in the nozzle upstream of the shock waveeven so, the stand-off
distance ofshock wave in front ofblunt model may be quite
sensitive to deviations from equilibrium .interferometric studies of supersonic flows about truncated

scale effects, and convergence to conical flowit was
found that flows over similar objects with equal tip

determined, andnumber of comparisons have
been made with theoretical predictions .review of panel flutter and effects of aerodynamic noise
with the development of high-speed aircraft and missiles, vibration
of panels has becomeproblem of practical significancemany
of the failures of the early german rockets after attaining supersonic
speed have been attributed to the development of such panel
oscillationsit appears this
phenomenon is not of much concern in the subsonic
speed range., however, in the supersonic speed range panels may develop
oscillations which cause instability of the structurethis effect has
been exhibited experimentally under controlled laboratory conditions
motion is limited and buckling may not beserious design problemin these cases panel flutter is still of importance because of its
effect on the fatigue life and the allowable stresses for design of
the panel materialthe oscillations of panels may be due either to aerodynamic force
induced by the motion of the panel, or to aerodynamic noise, or
buffeting (irregular motion induced by turbulence in the flow)the interaction between aerodynamic forces and panel motions, usually
referred to as /panel flutter,/ has been investigated by several workers
in recent yearssince the problem is too complex to be dealt with
in its entirety, simplifying assumptions have been made in these
investigationsthe literature is marked bycertain degree of controversy
over the validity of these assumptions and the applicability of
the results obtaineda brief review of the literature with reference
to several of the approximations made and the results obtained follows .nonuniform shear flow past cylindersa general method is described whereby
an approximation of any desired degree
of accuracy to the stream functions for
two types of variable shear flows past
finite cylinders can be obtainedthe two
shear distributions in the free stream can
be approximated to the linear shear
distribution and the shear present in an
unretarded incompressible boundary layer
respectivelyin every case the stagnation
streamline is displaced from the position
opposite the line of symmetry of the
cylinder, and general expressions are
obtained for this displacementthe line of
symmetry may be in the direction of

would occur if the basic flow were uniform) ..  slow attenuation
of the secondary-flow disturbance with distance
from the obstaclethe author conjectured (same j.the trouble was caused by nonuniform validity of the
approximation sequence in the region far from the obstaclethe analogy with /stokes' and whitehead's
paradoxes/ is mentioned, andsolution analogous to
oseen's is suggested, one in which disturbances, but not
the shear, are assumed to be smallin this paper, suchsolution is found, and is shown to overlap with the smallshear,
secondary-flow solutionthe basic flow isparallel,
steady, inviscid, two-dimensional shear flowthe /fundamental
solution/ due toweak source is soughtthe method of fourier transforms is usedsimple solutions
are found foruniformly sheared basic flow (where
the result coincides with the secondary-flow solution) and
for an exponential basic-flow profilein the general case
it is assumed that the parallel basic flow becomes uniform
at, where the x-axis lies in the flow directionthe character of the solution is determined by studying
its hankel transform, especially for the class of flows
where the total variation of the basic stream speed v(y)
is smallan interpretation in terms of images, due to

is presentedthe solutions are determined
for small mach numbers andprandtl number at the wall of 0.7 ,.
ranges of mainstream pressure gradients
and rates of coolant flow throughporous wall are considered for the
following cases ..  (1) small temperature
changes in the boundary layer
alongconstant- and alongvariabletemperature
wall, and (2) large
temperature changes in the boundary layer
alongconstant-temperature walldimensionless forms of heat-transfer
and friction parameters and
boundary-layer thicknesses are tabulatedthe results indicate that coolant
emission and increased stream-to-wall
temperature ratios diminished
the friction and heat transfer forconstant wall temperatureforvariable wall temperature with small
temperature differences in the boundary
layer, the friction was unaffected,
but the heat transfer was greatly
increased for increased wall-temperature
gradientheat-transfer results
in the literature reveal that transpiration
cooling is much more effective
for prandtl numbers of the order of 5.0 than for 0.7 .theoretical and experimental investigation of aerodynamicheating
the effect ofstrong, negative
pressure gradient upon the local
rate of heat transfer throughlaminar
boundary layer on the isothermal
surface of an electrically heated,
cylindrical body of revolution withhemispherical nose was determined from
wind-tunnel tests atmach number
of 1.97the investigation indicated
that the local heat-transfer parameter,
based on flow conditions
just outside the boundary layer,
decreased fromvalue of 0.65 0.10 at
the stagnation point of the hemisphere
tovalue  of 0.43 0.05 at the
junction with the cylindrical
afterbodybecause measurements of the
static pressure distribution over
the hemisphere indicated that the local
flow pattern tended to become
stationary as the free-stream mach number
was increased to 3.8, this distribution
of heat-transfer parameter is
believed representative of all
mach numbers greater than 1.97 and of
temperatures less than that of dissociationthe local heat-transfer
parameter was independent of reynolds
number based on body diameter in the
range from 0.6x10 to 2.3x10the measured distribution of
heat-transfer parameter agreed within
theoretical distribution calculated with
foreknowledge only of the pressure
distribution about the bodythis
method, applicable to any body of
revolution with an isothermal surface,
combines the mangler transformation,
stewartson transformation, and thermal
solutions to the falkner-skan wedge-flow
problem, and thus evaluates the
heat-transfer rate in axisymmetric
compressible flow in terms of the known
heat-transfer rate in an approximately
equivalent two-dimensional incompressible
flowmeasurements of recovery-temperature
distributions at mach numbers
of 1.97 and 3.04 yielded local recovery
factors having an average value
of 0.823 0.012 on the hemisphere which
increased abruptly at the shoulder
to an average value of 0.840 0.012 on
the cylindrical afterbodythis
result suggests that the usual representation
of the laminar recovery
factor as the square root of the prandtl
number is conservative in the
presence ofstrong, accelerating pressure gradient .viscous flow alongflat plate moving at high speedsby the distortion of coordinates, it is shown that, in the case
of supersonic viscous flow pastflat plate, the boundary-layer
and simple wave theories can be combined to givecomplete
representation of the velocity and pressure fieldsconsistent
first-order solutions are consideredan expression for the induced
pressure on the plate, correct to the second order, is obtainedat high mach numbers the important parameter satisfies
the hypersonic similarity law ,. and for arbitrary mach and
reynolds numbers and for different gases, the theoretical curve
correlates closely the experimental dataasymptotic shock
curve and skin-friction coefficient are also deduced, but the experimental
verifications are yet to be made .the boundary layer onflat plate instream with
the incompressible laminar boundary layer

sheara solution is obtained for
the first two terms of an asymptotic solution
for small viscosityit is shown that
one of the principal effects of free-stream
vorticity is to introducemodified
pressure field outside the boundary-layer region .on the theory of hypersonic gas flow withpower law
plane and axisymmetric hypersonic gas flows are considered with shock
waves of very great intensity that havepower-law formon the basis
of an investigation of the portions of the flow with high entropy adjoining
the surface of the body (not necessarily forshock wave of the
given form) it is shown that the use in the flow problem of the exact
solution for the corresponding unsteady self-similar gas motion requiressupplementary refinement of the thickness of the high entropy layera method is shown for introducing suchcorrection and constructing the
shape of the body contour, on which is to be applied the pressure distribution
obtained on the basis of the theory of small disturbances .blunt body heat transfer at hypersonic speed and low reynolds numbersan analytical method for the determination of effect of shock curvature
on heat transfer in the region of the nose has been developedit is
shown that for practical body shape the viscous terms in the navierstokes
equations are not important in the region of the flow far from
the wall, and the displacement thickness can be neglectedthen the
flow can be approximately represented by an inviscid-flow solution
having as boundary conditions the body shape, which is not affected by
the reynolds number, and byboundary-layer type of flow near the
wall, having appropriate boundary conditionsthis approach permits us
to determine the heat transfer in the region of the nose even at very
low reynolds numbersexperimental results are presentedthe experimental results agree
with the values given by the analysis .hypersonic shock layer theory of the stagnation region at low reynolds
cheng, h.k.
hypersonic flow at low reynolds number is studied utilizing the shocklayer
conceptthe present formulation takes into account the salient
features of the transport processes within the shock layer inmanner
consistent with the shock-layer approximationthe rankine-hugoniot
shock relations are modified to include contributions due to heat
conduction and viscous effects immediately behind the shockthe specific problem of an axisymmetric stagnation region is treatedthe flow regimes for this problem can be classified according to whether
 or not the transport effects are important immediately behind the
shockin one regime where the ordinary rankine-hugoniot relations hold
 across the shock, the vorticity-interaction theory based on the
boundary-layer approximation is shown to be sufficientin the other
regime where the rankine-hugoniot relations have to be modified but the
continuum-flow model applies, an approximate, an analytical solution is
obtainedthis solution revealssubstantial reduction of the
temperature behind the shock and of the shock stand-off distance in the
presence of strong surface coolingthe present study is intended to provideknowledge to bridge the gap
between the free-molecule flow regime and that of the boundary layer via
 the continuum theoryin this respect, the solution obtained appears
to be satisfactory in that it yields the correct free-molecule limits
for the skin friction and surface-heat transfer rate .measurements of stagnation point heat transfer at low
measurements of stagnation point heat transfer are presented
in the reynolds number range between the free molecular flow
and the range where modified boundary layer theory still appliesthe measurements are compared with the analytical methods

to give lift, drag and aerodynamic-centre characteristics, are used to
check some calculation methods for the growth of the turbulent boundary
layer and for the effect ofknown boundary layer on the pressure
distributionit is concluded that the calculation of the boundary layer still needslittle refinement before it is accurate enough to predict viscosity

an investigation was conducted in the n. a. c. a.
full-scale wind tunnel onsmall parasol monoplane
equipped with three different split trailing-edge wing
flapsthe object of the investigation was to determine
and correlate data on the characteristics of the airplane
and flaps as affected by variation in flap chord, flap
deflection, and flap location along the wing chordthe
chords of the flaps were 10, 20, and 30 percent of the
wing chord and each flap was tested at deflections fromto 75 when located successively at 68, 80, and 88.8
percent of the wing chord aft of the leading edgethe
investigation included force tests, pressure-distribution
tests, and downwash surveysthe results give the lift,
the drag, and the pitching-moment characteristics of the
airplane, the flap forces and moments, the pressure
distribution over the flaps and wing at one section,
and the downwash characteristics of the flap and wing
combinationsan increase in flap chord or distance of the flap from
the leading edge of the wing increased the lift of the airplane
but had an adverse effect on the wing pitching
momentthe ld ratio of the airplane decreased with
increase in flap deflection or flap chordflap normalforce
coefficients were primarilyfunction of flap deflection
and were relatively independent of flap chord, hingeaxis
location, and airplane attitudethe location of
the flap center of pressure in percentage of flap chord aft of
the hinge axis remained practically constant irrespective
of airplane attitude and of flap deflection, chord, or
locationflap hinge-moment coefficients varied withpower of flap chord greater than the square so that with
regard to hinge moments narrow flaps were the most
efficient in producinggiven increase in liftsplit trailing-edge flaps materially affected the magnitude
and distribution of pressures over the entire wing
profileat low angles of attack the predominant effect
of the flaps was to increase positively the lower-surface
pressures ,. at high angles of attack, to increase negatively
the upper-surface pressuresdownwash surveys indicated
that horizontal tail planes located above the wing
chord line would be more effective than those below the
chord in counteracting the increased diving moment of
the airplane with flaps deflected .the shapes and lift-dependent drags on some sweptback

the methods of the classical aerofoil theory are used to derivegeneral theory for wings of any given planformthe load over the
whole surface ofgiven wing can be calculated atgiven subcritical
mach number, and the procedure is as simple and rapid as that of the
classical aerofoil theorythe calculated results are confirmed by
experiments .methods for calculating the lift distribution of wings /subsonic lifting
this report contains some fairly simple and economic methods for
calculating the load distribution on wings of any plan form based on
the conceptions of lifting surface theorythe computer work required
is onlysmall fraction of that of existing methods with comparable
accuracythis is achieved byvery careful choice of the positions
of pivotal points, by plotting once for all those parts of the downwash
integral which occur frequently and byconsequent application of
approximate integration methods similar to those devised by the author
for lifting line problemsthe basis of the method is to calculate the local lift and pitching
moment atnumber of chordwise sections fromset of linear equations
satisfying the downwash conditions at two pivotal points in each
sectioninterpolation functions of trigonometrical form are used for
spanwise integration both in setting up the downwash equations and in
getting the resultant forces on the wing from the local forcesthe
preliminary chordwise integrations for the downwash are predigested inseries of charts/figs.1-6/,.it is these which make the methodpractical computing propositionthe theory is outlined in sections 2-5,.sectiondeals with the
solution of the linear equation and sectionwith the resultant forces
on the wingsome examples are worked out in sectionto compare with
other methods,. one solution is given in full detail in tables 8-30 asguide for computersappendices i-vi discuss more carefully some

to instruct the computer how to carry out the steps of the calculation .the effect of end plates on swept wingsexisting methods of calculating
the effect of endplates on straight
wings are modified so as to apply to
swept wingsthe changes in overall

distribution of the additional load,
can be calculatedthe theoretical results are
compared with experimental results
obtained on swept wings, including
new measurements of lift, drag and
pitching moment, made on an untaperedthe method of calculation is also
extended to cover the effect of
the tip vortex which is formed on wings
without endplates .low speed tests on 45 sweptback wingsthis report contains the results
of pressure measurements on three
and aspect ratio 5, over an
incidence range up to 10chordwise
and spanwise lift distributions
are given, mostly near the centre
where, on two of the wings, modifications
had been made to the section
shapeit was found that altering
the thickness distribution in the
centre did not affect the loading but
that approximately straight isobars
could be obtained at values of
below about 0.1by the incorporation
of twist and camber in the central
part the distortion of the lift
distribution in the centre could be
avoided at one particular incidence,
and thus the same chordwise
distribution obtained over most of the spantwist and camber alone do not improve
the isobar pattern and
thereforethickness modification would be
needed to give the desired
lift distribution and isobar pattern at one
particular incidencethe results of experimental investigations
of the boundary layer
and of the effect of aspect ratio will be given
inlater report .generalized conical flow fields in supersonic wing theorylinearized, compressible-flow analysis is applied to the study of
quasi-conical supersonic wing theorysingle-integral equations are
derived which relate either the loading to the shape oflifting
surface or the thickness ofsymmetrical wing to the pressure distribution
for triangular wings with subsonic leading edgesthe forms of
these equations and their inversions are simplified through the introduction
of the finite part and the generalized principal part of an
integralapplications of the theory, in the lifting case, include previously
known resultsin the nonlifting case, it is shown that forspecified
 pressure distribution the theory does not always predictunique
thickness distributionthis is demonstrated fortriangular plan form
 havingconstant pressure gradient in the stream direction .integrals and integral equations in linearized wing theorythe formulas of subsonic and supersonic wing theory for source, doublet,
 and vortex distributions are reviewed, andsystematic presentation is
 provided which relates these distributions to the pressure and to the
vertical induced velocity in the plane of the wingit is shown that
care must be used in treating the singularities involved in the analysis
 and that the order of integration is not always reversibleconcepts
suggested by the irreversibility of order of integration are shown to be
 useful in the inversion of singular integral equations when operational
 techniques are useda number of examples are given to illustrate the
methods presented, attention being directed to supersonic flight
speeds .the lift of twisted and cambered wings in supersonic flowa generalised conical flow theory is used to deduce an integral equation
 relating the velocity potential ondelta wing/with subsonic leading
edges/to the given downwash distribution over the wingthe complete
solution of this integral equation is derivedthis complete solution
is composed of two parts, one being symmetric and the other antisymmetric
with respect to the spanwise co-ordinate,. each part
representsvelocity potentialfor example, ifis the spanwise
co-ordinate andis measured in the free stream direction, thendownwash of the form w-a ux/y/is symmetric and will give rise tosymmetric potential, whereas w-a ux/y/sgnis anti-symmetric and gives
rise to an anti-symmetric potentialthe velocity potentials of such
flows are given in the form of tables for all downwashes up to and
including homogenous cubics in the spanwise and streamwise
co-ordinatestable iii gives similar formulae in the limiting case
were used overcycle of the tumbling motionthe analytical expression
was in good agreement with numerical solutions of the complete nonlinear
equations of motion .the use of conical camber to produce flow attachment at the leading
in an attempt to avoid flow separation at the leading edge ofthin
delta wing with subsonic leading edges, an attachment line is prescribed
 therethis is done by requiring the load, as predicted by attached
flow theory, to vanish along the leading edge at the design lift
coefficientfor sonic speed,complete account of this flow is given
in terms of slender wing theory and the load distributions corresponding
 to arbitrary conical camber are calculatedfor supersonic speeds
load distributions arising in the slender wing theory are considered and
 the corresponding conical camber distributions are found by linearized
theorythe lift-dependent drag forgiven lift is then minimized with
 respect to the coefficients oflinear combination of these load distributionsit is found that the lift-dependent drag factor for these
conically cambered wings approaches the value it takes for the attached
flow/in which leading edge suction occurs/past the uncambered wing at
the same mach number, as more terms are included in the linear combinationhowever, when the leading edge is almost sonic an appreciable
reduction is predictedthe corresponding load distributions and wing
shapes are calculated and drawnthe optimum shapes forfixed number
of terms resemble flat plates drooped downwards near their edges, so
that the localised leading edge suction is replaced bydistributed
force onforward-facing surface, producing an effect of similar
magnitude .tables of complete elliptic integralsthe present paper containsset of tables of complete elliptic
integrals computed and collected especially for applications to certain
dynamical problemsthe tabulated functions are four in number and are denoted by
f/a/, g/a/, e/a/, and/a,b/respectivelythe definitions of these
functions and their connections with the functions of legendre will be
discussed in the following .aerodynamic effects of some configuration variables
results of flutter tests on
some simple all-movable-control-type
models are givenone set of models,
which hadsquare planform with
double-wedge airfoils with four
different values of leading- and trailingedge
radii fromtopercent chord
and airfoil thicknesses of 9, 11,
at mach numbers from 0.7 to 6.86the bending-to-torsion frequency
ratio was about 0.33the other set of
models, which hadtapered planform
with single-wedge and double-wedge
airfoils with thicknesses of 3, 6, 9,
and 12 percent chord, was tested
at mach numbers from 0.7 to 3.98 andfrequency ratio of about 0.42the tests indicate that, in general,
increasing thickness hasdestabilizing effect at the higher mach
numbers but is stabilizing at
subsonic and transonic mach numbersdouble-wedge airfoils are more
prone to flutter than single-wedge
airfoils at comparable stiffness
levelsincreasing airfoil bluntness
hasstabilizing effect on the
flutter boundary at supersonic speeds
but hasnegligible effect at
subsonic speedshowever, increasing
bluntness may also lead to divergence
at supersonic speedsresults of calculations using
second-order piston-theory aerodynamics
in conjunction withcoupled-mode
analysis and an uncoupled-mode analysis
are compared with the experimental
results for the sharp-edge airfoils at
supersonic speedsthe uncoupled-mode
analysis more accurately predicted
the flutter characteristics of the
tapered-planform models, whereas the
coupled-mode analysis was somewhat
better for the square-planform modelsfor both the uncoupled- and coupled-mode
analyses, agreement with the
experimental results improved with
increasing mach numberin general,
both methods of analysis gave unconservative
results with respect to the
experimental flutter boundaries .flutter tests of some simple models atmach number
results of hypersonic flutter
tests on some simple models are presentedthe models had rectangular
plan forms of panel aspect ratio 1.0,
no sweepback, and bending-to-torsion
frequency ratios of abouttwo
airfoil sections were included in the
tests ,. double wedges of 5-, 10-,
and 15-percent thickness and flat plates
with straight, parallel sides
and beveled leading and trailing edgesthe models were supported bycantilevered shaftthe double-wedge wings were tested
in helium atmach number of 7.2an effect of airfoil thickness on flutter
speed was found, thicker wings
requiring more stiffness to avoid fluttera few tests in air atmach
number of 6.9 showed the same thickness
effect and also indicated that
tests in helium would predict conservative
flutter boundaries in airthe data in air and helium seemed to be
correlated by piston-theory calculationspiston-theory calculations
agreed well with experiment for
the thinner models but began to deviate
as the thickness parameter
approached and exceeded 1.0a few tests on flat-plate models
with various elastic-axis locations
were madepiston-theory calculations
would not satisfactorily predict
the flutter of these models, probably
because of their blunt leading
edges .oscillating airfoils at high mach numbera simple formula is given for the pressure distribution on an
oscillating airfoil in two-dimensional flow at high mach numberthe
formula is expected to be reasonably accurate if the pressure on the
surface remains within the range 0.2 to 3.5 times the mainstream
pressureto illustrate the application of the formula, some results
for symmetrical airfoils performing pitching oscillations are obtained
and compared with results obtained from existing theories in the case of
 high mach number .tables of aerodynamic coefficients obtained from developed newtonian
closed-form expressions and tables composed from these expressions are
presented for complete and partial conic and spheric bodies at combined
angles of attack and sideslip in newtonian flowaerodynamic
coefficients of these bodies are tabulated for various body segments
overrange of angles of attack from 1degree to 85degree and angles of
sideslip from 0degree to 15degreesome comparisons between newtonian predictions and hypersonic
experimental aerodynamic characteristics were made for conic bodies
having various surface slopes, nose bluntnesses, and body cross sections
 to indicate the range of validity of the theoryin general, the
theory is shown to agree quite well with experimental results for
sharp-nose complete cones and for configurations having large blunted
noses and steep surface slopeshowever, agreement between theory and
experiment generally is poor for the more slender, slightly blunted
complete or half conic bodies and also for sharp-nose half conic bodies
where real-flow phenomena such as forebody interference, viscous forces,
 leeward surface contributions, or leading-edge pressure reductions may
have significant effectthe agreement between theory and experiment
for the bodies considered can be improved by using the stagnation pressure
coefficient behindnormal shock rather thanas the newtonian
coefficient, although for the sharp-nose half conic bodies there is no
theoretical justification for this modification .investigation of the laminar aerodynamics heat transferprogram to investigate the aerodynamic heat transfer ofnonisothermal hemisphere-cylinder has been conducted in the

exhauststhese jet exhausts werehot jet /hydrogen burned in air/,cold air jet,cold helium jet, andjet composed ofmixture of two
 cold gases /hydrogen and carbon dioxide/the hot jet, because of its

line for the nozzle positions and pressure ratios of the investigationthe chordwise coordinate approached zero as the jet vertical distance
beneath the wing increasedin the spanwise direction there was little
change due to varying rocket-jet position and pressure ratiosome
boundary-layer flow separation on the wing was observed for the rocket
jets close to the wing and at the higher pressure ratiosthe magnitude
 of the chordwise and spanwise pressure distributions due to jet interference
was greatest for rocket jets close to the wing and decreased as

by correcting the aerodynamic inertia and the angle of attack of
 the infinite wingthe calculations are based on the operational
methodthe starting lift of the finite wing is found to be only slightly less
than that of the infinite wing,. whereas the final lift may be considerably
lessthe theory indicates that the initial distribution of
lift is similar to the final distributioncurves showing the variation of lift aftersudden unit change in angle
 of attack, during penetration ofsharpedge gust, and duringcontinuous
oscillation are givenoperational equivalents of these
functions have been devised to facilitate the calculation of lift under
various conditions of motionas an application of these formulas, the
vertical acceleration ofloaded wing caused by penetratinggust has
been calculated .approximate indical lift functions for several wings of finite span in
the unsteady-lift functions forwing undergoingsudden change in
sinking speed have been presented for delta wings having aspect ratios
of 0, 2, andand for rectangular and elliptical wings having aspect
ratios of 0, 3, and. for the elliptical and rectangular wings the
spanwise lift distributions were also presentedthese functions were
calculated from the lift coefficients associated withwing oscillating
 harmonically in pure translational motion, as obtained from several
sourcesthe results of these calculations indicate that the normalized
unsteady-lift functions are substantially independent of the shape of
the plan form for elliptical, rectangular, or moderately tapered wings,.
 however, for delta wings the increase of lift toward the steady-state
value is much more rapid than that for the aforementioned wings of the
same aspect ratiothese results also corroborate the results of other
investigations in that the rate of growth of lift tends to increase withdecrease in aspect ratiothe shape of the spanwise distributions of
 the indicial lift seems to be, for all practical purposes, independent
of time for rectangular and elliptical wings .two and three-dimensional unsteady lift problems in high speed flightthe problem of transient lift on two- and three-dimensional wings flying
 at high speeds is discussed asboundary-value problem for the
classical wave equationkirchhoffs formula is applied so that the
analysis is reduced, just as in the steady state, to an investigation of
 sources and doubletsthe applications include the evaluation of
indicial lift and pitchingmoment curves for two-dimensional sinking and
pitching wings flying at mach numbers equal to 0, 0.8, 1.0, 1.2, and
triangular wings in both forward and reversed flow are presented and
compared with the two-dimensional values .numerical determination of indical lift oftwo-dimensional sinking
the reciprocal equations for relating the incompressible circulatory
indicial lift to the lift due to harmonic oscillations have been
modified to include the noncirculatory lift associated with apparentmass
effectsalthough the apparent-mass effects are impulsive in
nature in incompressible flow, the lift due to apparent-mass effects in
compressible flow istime-dependent functionthe corresponding
reciprocal equations for the total compressible lift are givenby use
of the reciprocal equations for compressible flow, the indicial lift and
 moment functions due to an airfoil's experiencingsudden acquisition
of vertical velocity are determined numerically for mach number 0.7lack of sufficient flutter coefficients prevents the calculation of
these functions at other mach numbersalthough the indicial lift and moment functions due to penetration ofsharp-edge gust may be obtained from the oscillatory tab or aileron coefficients
bysimilar analysis, sufficient coefficients are not
available at the presenthowever, an approximate method is shown for
determiningportion of this unsteady-lift functionwhencomparison is made of the indicial lift functions at mach numbers
appears to be less rapid for the compressible case than for the incompressible
caseconsequently, the calculation of the gust load factor
at high subsonic mach numbers utilizing the two-dimensional incompressible
indicial lift functions and an over-all correction for compressibility
such as the prandtl-glauert factor might be conservative .numerical determination of indical lift and moment functions fortwo
the indicial lift and moment functions are determined approximately for
sinking and pitching motion at mach numbersof 0.5 and 0.6these
functions are determined fromknowledge of the existing oscillatory
coefficients at the low reduced frequencies and from approximate expressions
of these coefficients at the high reduced frequenciesthe beginning portion of the indicial lift function associated with an
airfoil penetratingsharp-edge gust in subsonic flow is evaluated by
use of an exact methodby use of an approximate method for determining
 the remaining portion, the complete indicial gust function is determined
for0.5,0.6, and0.7all the indicial lift and moment functions are approximated by an exponential
series,. the coefficients which appear in the exponential

prandtl's integral equations, as well as new ones for the wing of infinite
span with periodic downwash distribution and for the oscillating
wing with high aspect ratiolastly, several solutions and methods for
solving these integral equations are given .a systematic kernel function procedure for determining aerodynamicdetailed description is given ofmethod of approximating solutions
to the integral equation that relates oscillatory or steady lift and
downwash distributions on finite wings in subsonic flowthe method of
solution is applicable to general plan forms with either curved or

notable simplicity, and an analogy with transient electrical flows is
drawn .thermal analysis of stagnation regions with emphasis on heat-sustaining
the leading edges and noses of hypersonic vehicles are subjected to
severe aerodynamic heating and must be cooled in some manner-dash e.g.,
internal convection, transpiration, or radiationit is this latter
mode of handling the problem that is discussed in this paperneglecting
conduction in the leading-edge region, the maximum temperature for
long-range hypersonic gliders is of the same order as the melting point
of refractory materials, withcorresponding large temperature gradient
 away from the leading edgeinclusion of conduction in the aft direction
reduces the maximum temperature and distributes the heat tolocation that will radiate it out from the surfacefor either steadystate
or transient conditions, the temperature at the leading edge is
reduced by conduction, while the temperature aft of the leading-edge
shoulder is increased, thus setting upheat transmission balance between
the convective influx of heat, the redistribution of heat by conduction,
and the radiation of heat from the surfacethe feasibility of
 suchmechanism can be enhanced by suitably choosing leading-edge
shapes and materialsthe philosophy behind the choice of leading-edge
shapes is discussed and the effects of varying parameters, such as
shape, diameter, emissivity, conductivity, thickness, etc., are shown .aerodynamic characteristics of two winged reentry vehicles at supersonic

an investigation was made to determine the smallest size of isolated
roughness that will affect transition inlaminar-boundary layercritical heights for three types of roughness were found inlow-speed
wind tunnelthe types were /1/ two-dimensional spanwise wires, /2/
three-dimensional discs, and /3/sandpaper typein addition to type
of roughness, test variables included the location of roughness, pressure
distribution, degree of tunnel turbulence, and length of natural
laminar flowthe most satisfactory correlation parameter was found to be the roughness
reynolds number, based on the height of roughness and flow properties
at this heightthe value of this critical reynolds number was
found to be substantially independent of all test variables except the
shape of roughnessthis parameter also correlates well other published
 data on critical roughness in low-speed flowthe value of the roughness
reynolds number necessary to move transition forward to the roughness
itself was also determined for the three types of roughness and was
 found to be approximately constant forgiven type of roughnessan investigation of the limited amount of available data on critical
roughness in supersonic flow indicates that the effects of roughness may
 still be correlated by the roughness reynolds numberthe value of
this reynolds number depends primarily on the mach number at the top of
the roughnesswhen this mach number is greater than 1.0, the roughness
 reynolds number based on conditions behindshock is probably the
characteristic parameter .an investigation at subsonic speeds of aerodynamic characteristics at

with various fuselage sizesan effort has been made to estimate the
lift variation with angle of attack for the wing planforms of the
present investigationimprovements in the lifting capabilities at low subsonic speeds associated
withbasic triangular planform of low aspect ratio are possible
by slight alterations in leading-edge design, which should still conform
 to possible design requirements at hypersonic speedsthese changes in
 planform resulted in increases in lift-curve slope, lift at high angles
 of attack, and in the maximum untrimmed lift-drag ratio, provided the
fuselage was sufficiently smallthe longitudinal stability characteristics
of the majority of planforms indicate more desirable stability
characteristics at high lifts than eithertriangular wing or rectangular
wing of the same aspect ratiothe effects of increasing reynolds
number for each of the planforms investigated generally resulted
in slight reductions in the lift at high angles of attacka method is
presented for estimating the subsonic-lift variation with angle of
attack for the low-aspect-ratio wings of the present investigation and
indicated good agreement with experimental data throughout the angleof-attack

 were obtained from machine calculated solutions of the six-degree-offreedom
rigid-body equations of motion using experimental aerodynamic
characteristics for the vehiclesone of the vehicles hadflat base
and was statically stable in two attitudes /nose forward and base forward/the other vehicle, derived from the first by addingconical
afterbody, was statically stable in only one attitude /nose forward/a 10-rpm vehicle spin rate, believed ample for the purpose of
distributing solar and aerodynamic heating over the vehicle surface, and
 model atmospheres encompassing the probable extremes for the planet
were also consideredit was found that while the motion of the flat-based vehicle could be
oscillatory about either the nose-forward or base-forward stable trim
attitudes when aerodynamic heating rates were high, the range of initial
 angles of attack resulting in base-forward orientation was reduced by
more thanfactor of 3. when initial pitch rates were increased from
body having only nose-forward stability showed that oscillatory angles
of attack at maximum heating-rate conditions probably would not exceed
about 25degrees although angles of attack when heating rates were 50
percent of maximum could be as high as 40degreevalues of these upper
bound angles of attack were essentially independent of initial pitch
rates for the range consideredfurthermore, the envelope of maximum
probable angles of attack was increased only slightly when the vehicle
was given10-rpm spin ratethe relationship between maximum amplitudes
of oscillation and heating rates through high heating portions of
the trajectories was preserved when model atmospheres believed to encompass
the extreme possibilities for mars were used in the calculationsmeans and examples of aeronautical research in france at oneracosmonautics is currently very much to the forefront in the newsit embraces and extends aeronautics, andwould like to propose

over-all sound pressure without afterburning was found
to be about 42 pounds per square foot along the jet boundary in
the region immediately downstream of the jet-nozzle exitwith afterburning the maximum sound pressure was increased
by 50 percentthe largest sound pressures without afterburning
were obtained onconstant percentage band width basis in
the frequency range from 350 to 700 cpsadditional tests were made atfew points to find the effect
of jet velocity on near-field sound pressures and to determine
the difference in value between sound-pressure levels at rigid

surface ofrigid plate that was large compared with the distance
over whichpositive correlation existedthe region of positive correlation was generally found to
increase with distance downstream of the engine to 6.5 nozzleexit

from unity correlation to the first zero correlation was greater for
lateral than for longitudinal correlations for the same conditions

surfaces .random excitation oftailplane section by jet noisethe response ofsection of tailplane structure to both discrete
and random noise pressures has been studied in detailinitially the
specimen was mounted behindjet engine and the induced strains were
analysed with the object of determining both the resonant frequencies
and the corresponding modes of vibrationduring these testssurvey
was made of the spectrum and correlation pattern of the jet noise on
the surface of the modelsecondly the specimen was mounted in front
ofloudspeaker in an acoustics laboratory and the structural
resonances were excited by means of discrete frequency soundthe mode
shapes were studied in detail with the aid ofstroboscopeit is concluded that the tailplane skin on this particular piece
of structure only responds to any significant degree in one structural
modealthough reasonable comparison has been obtained between the
random and discrete tests, it was not possible to calculate the induced
stresses using the observed mode shapes and measured pressure
excitation .on the fatigue failure of structures due to vibrations excited
on the assumption that the forced modes of vibration ofstructure,
subjected to pressure fluctuations random in time and space, can be
approximated by the composition of the motions of the uncoupled
natural modes,general analysis is made using the ideas of vibration
theory and spectrum analysisthe power spectrum, and hence the
rms value, of any quantity depending linearly upon structural
distortions is derived and it involvesquantity (called the /joint
acceptance/) concerning the spacewise structure of the pressure
field and of the geometry of the modes of vibrationit is shown how
this result may be used (on assuming /normal/ randomness) to estimate
the fatigue life on the hypothesis of cumulative damage .structural acoustic proof testingwith the introduction of high-powered
propulsion systems, and paralleling their
continued development, an accompanying
increase in acoustical problems has arisenof these acoustical problems, that of
acoustical fatigue failures has become paramount
in the eyes of the structural engineeraircraft

been known literally to fall apart under acoustical
loadingthis problem has required much endeavour
to producesolution, and considerable
structural research, based upon results of siren or
other testing, have proved inadequatethis
failure to findsatisfactory solution has resulted
in the conviction that the final proof ofdesign
can be found only in proof testingproof testing,
in the acoustic fatigue sense, is the testing ofdesign structure insimulated acoustical environment

considerable value for those concerned with response of aircrafttype

stress spectrum and the /equivalent fatigue stress/ of an elastic
structure subjected to random loading are studiedthe analysis
is simplified by assuming the structure to have onlysingle degree
of freedom and by using the concept of cumulative damage,

in the nature of failures
experienced for the two types of loadingsatgiven root-mean-square
stress level, the failure times were
generally shorter for the random
loading than for the discrete-frequency
loadingthese differences in
failure times were noted to befunction
of stress level, the larger
differences occurring at the lower stress levelsincreases in time to failure were
obtained asresult of increased
panel thickness, increased panel curvature,
and particularly for increased
static-pressure differential across curved panelsfor the discrete-type loading,

satisfactorily accomplished but

results forparticular structural configuration agree favorably with
available experimental measurements .stresses in continuous skin stiffener panels under random loadingtheoretical aspects involved in the prediction of stress levels for
continuous skin-stiffener panels subjected torandom pressure field
are considered in the light of powell's general theory for statistical
superposition of modal responsethe choice of structural model is
dictated by the prevalence of skin-stiffener construction in modern
flight vehicle designthe present study clearly demonstrates that any
truly adequate prediction of stress levels in actual aircraft structures
 requiresmuch better representation of structural characteristics
than can be provided by single panel idealizationsin an example considering
fuselage panels exposed to jet engine noise, essential agreement
is shown with experimental data, although better correlation is
shown for rms stress than for power spectrumit is shown that reduction
of stress level by increasing damping is effective only in the
higher frequency range .on the bending ofclamped platethe present paper contains an application
ofrecently developed variational
method to the boundary value problem of the
bending ofclamped plate of arbitrary
shapeit will be shown that this problem
can be linked to the simpler problem
of the equilibrium ofmembrane bychain
of intermediate problems, which can be
solved explicitly and in finite form in terms
of the membrane problemin the intermediate
problems, the deflection converges
uniformly in the domain of the plate
of the clamped plate, and the derivatives
of all orders of the deflection converge
uniformly in every domain completely interior
to the plate(in the ritz method, not even
the convergence of the slopes can be
guaranteed .)  the method yields numerical
results for plates of all shapes for which
the membrane problem (which we shall call
the base problem) admits an explicit solutionas an example we shall considerclamped square plate underuniform loadthis problem has been the object of
numerous investigations, some of which are
theoretical, while others are purely numerical,
use infinite simple and double series,
and operate with an infinite number of
linear equations and an infinite number of
unknownsan inspection of the general
formulae derived in the present paper, formulae
which become simple in numerical
applications, would show how some of the
numerical methods might be rendered
rigorousthe convergence of higher derivatives
is of great practical interest for
the approximate computation of the stresses .upper and lower bounds for the solution of the first

the displacement offlat plate bent
by transverse loading, and the extensional
or in 'plane stress', are governed by equations
of identical form ,. and the boundary
conditions have identical form when edgedisplacements
are specified in the flexural,
edge-tractions in the extensional problem,
so mathematically, in these circumstances,
onlysingle problem is presentedthis,
the 'first analogue' relating flexure and
extension, is well knowna 'second analogue', relating the flexural
problem when edge-tractions with the
extensional problem when edge-displacements
are specified, is believed to have been
first propounded in 1941by introducing
two quantitiesand v, analogous with
the componentsandof extensional
displacement, it permitstreatment of the
flexural problem by any method--e.g.
which yields extensional solutions of this
second typein this paper both analogues are combined
in an inclusive statement covering the
perforated (multiply connected) plates which
were discussed in 1948reasons are
stated for believing that 'two-diagram technique'
is preferable in problems governed
by 'mixed' boundary conditions .the bending ofsectorial platethe problem of evaluating the bending moments, existing
inuniformly loaded clamped plate having the form
ofsector ofring, is one which arises in connection with
the stress analysis of reinforced piston heads and in other
design problemsin this paper, expressions are derived
for the bending moments along the edges of suchplatesimilar problems, i.e., those of the clamped rectangular
plate under uniform pressure, undercentral concentrated
load, and that of the simply supported sector ofdisk under uniform pressure, have been discussed by
previous authorsthe general approach used in the foregoing
problems is adopted in the present case ,.considerable
reduction in the computational work is achieved,
however, by the use of an integral-equation method of
solving the boundary-condition equationsnumerical
results are obtained for plates of various dimensions, and
the edge moment distributions are plotted for these casescurves are also plotted which indicate the relationship
existing between the maximum bending moments derived
for sectorial plates and those previously obtained for
clamped rectangular plates of similar size .the bending of uniformly loaded clamped plate in the
the deflexion ofuniformly loaded
plate in the form ofsemicircle clamped
along its boundary is obtained bymethod due to weinsteinthis problem
requires the solution of the biharmonic
equation whereis given,
subject to the conditions that=and
on the boundary,being the
direction of the outward normalthe solution
is expressed in the form
where, writing is found
by solving (in succession) two harmonic
equations of the forms wheremay
be zero, and whereand
have to satisfy certain boundary conditionsthe constants are then determined
to satisfy the boundary conditionnumerical calculations show that five or six
terms of the series givegood approximation to the accurate value as
judged by the closeness with which
the approximate solution satisfies the boundary
conditionthe procedure
to be adopted in the case of the general
circular sector and for non-uniform
loading is indicated brieflythe connexion between the deflexion problem
and that of plane strain in which
the stress function satisfies the equation,
where and have given
values on the boundary, is discussed aspreliminary
to the further consideration
of the latter problem bymethod of the same type .the bending of uniformly loaded sectorial plates with
this paper analyzes the bending ofsectorial plate,

the problem of bending ofwedge-shaped thin elastic
plate with arbitrary boundary conditions on the radial edges
in the case ofsingle loadthe solution is carried out forplate with clamped edges andsingle load on the bisector
radius of the platestress distribution along the edges
is shown and the behavior of the solution near the corner
point is discussed for several opening angles of the plate .on the analysis of elastic plates of variable thicknessthe extensional and flexural equations
governing the elastic behaviour ofplate
of variable thickness are expressed in
terms of the laplacian operatortemperature

effects of initial irregularities, are also
discussed .finding zero's of arbitrary functionsa method for finding real and complex
roots of polynomial equations, due to
d. muller, is applied to finding roots of
general equations of the form f(z)0,
where f(z) is analytic in the neighborhood
of the rootsthe procedure does not
depend on any prior knowledge of the
location of the roots nor on any special
starting processall that is required is
the ability to evaluate f(z) for any desired
value of.  multiple roots can also be
obtaineda general purpose program,

arbitrary matrices ,. finding zeros of the
generalized eigenvalue problem ,. finding
roots ofnumber of transcendental
equations .the buckling of thin cylindrical shells under axial
in two previous papers the authors have discussed
in detail the inadequacy of the classical theory of
thin shells in explaining the buckling phenomenon of
cylindrical and spherical shellsit was shown that
not only the calculated buckling load istotimes
higher than that found by experiments, but the observed
wave pattern of the buckled shell is also different
from that predictedfurthermore, it was pointed
out that the different explanations for this discrepancy
advanced by l. h. donnell and w. flugge are untenable
when certain conclusions drawn from these explanations
are compared with the experimental factsbytheoretical investigation on spherical shells the
authors were led to the belief that in general the
buckling phenomenon of curved shells can only be explained
by means ofnon-linear large deflection theorythis point of view was substantiated by model experiments
on slender columns with non-linear elastic supportthe non-linear characteristics of such structures
cause the load necessary to keep the shell in equilibrium
to drop very rapidly with increase in wave amplitude
once the structure started to bucklethus, first
of all,part of the elastic energy stored in the shell is
released once the buckling has started,. this explains
the observed rapidity of the buckling processfurthermore,
as it was shown in one of the previous papers
the buckling load itself can be materially reduced by
slight imperfections in the test specimen and vibrations
during the testing processin this paper, the same ideas are applied to the case
ofthin uniform cylindrical shell under axial compressionfirst it is shown by an approximate calculation
that again the load sustained by the shell drops
with increasing deflectionthen the results of this
calculation are used formore detailed discussion of
the buckling process as observed in an actual testing
machine .the behaviour ofcylindrical shell under axial compression
the value of the compressive stress at whichthin circular cylindrical shell becomes unstable has been
worked out theoretically by southwell (1914)subsequent
experimental results, however, have indicated that this
value is appreciably too high and that the form of distortion
which occurs in practice differs from that assumed in theoryin recent years much work has been done on this problem
in americalundquist (1933) and donnell (1934)
have concluded that the buckling ofcylindrical shell is greatly
influenced by initial irregularities,. von karman and
tsien (1941) have indicated thatthin cylindrical shell can be
maintained inbuckled state bycompressive load
considerably smaller than that previously predicted by theorythe present paper is an extension of the work of von karman
and tsienit shows that the smallest load which will
keepthin cylindrical shell inbuckled condition is about one-third
of that given by southwell,result in very fair
agreement with experiment, and that once the cylinder has buckled,
and so long as the stresses remain within the elastic
range of the material, the cylinder has only about one-quarter of its
original stiffness .the behaviour of thin cylindrical shells after buckling
the fundamental investigations of von karman and tsien
on the buckling of cylindrical shells under axial compression
are continuedthe energy expression is simplified and minimized
with respect to the axial and circumferential wave-length
parameterssolution of the equations obtained yields curves
of the reduced average stress and of the wave dimensions plotted
against the reduced average strainthey illustrate the behavior
of the cylinder during the buckling processthe minimum
buckling stress is found to be 0.195e(tr) .post-buckling behaviour of axially compressed circular
the postbuckling characteristics of an axially compressed
thin-walled circular cylindrical shell loaded either by dead weights
or byrigid testing machine are determinedit is shown that
for either loading condition the minimum applied stress in the
postbuckling region is 0.182(er) and that the region of stable
equilibrium corresponding to loading by the rigid testing machine
includes and extends beyond that obtained with dead weight
loadingthe work here described iscontinuation of work done
earlier by von karman and tsien, by michielsen, and by leggett
and jones .new developments in the nonlinear theories of the buckling of thin
in the present papershort survey will be given first of the buckling
and postbuckling behavior of isotropic cylindrical shells subjected
to different loading conditions as obtained by the nonlinear theory
of finite deflections of shells during the last twenty yearsnextreport will be given on new investigations carried out in the
structures department of the dvl concerning the elastic stability of
isotropic and orthotropic cylindrical shells loaded in axial compression
and internal pressurethese studies are based on the nonlinear theory
of finite deformationsthe theoretical rsults will be compared with
new experimental results obtained withseries of axially loaded
pressurized isotropic and orthotropic cylindrical shells .lower buckling load in the non-linear buckling theory
for thin shells the relation between
the loadand the deflection beyond the
classical buckling load is very often
non-linearfor instance, whenuniform thin
circular cylinder is loaded in the axial
direction, the loadwhen plotted against the
end-shortening has the characteristic
shown in fig..  if the strain energyand the
total potential are calculated,
their behavior can be represented by the
curves shown in figs.and.  it can be
demonstrated that the branches oc and ab
corresponds to stable equilibrium configurations
and the branch bc to unstable equilibrium
configurationsthe pointis then
the point of transition from stable to unstable
equilibrium configurations .an automatic method for finding the greatest or least

incorporated inprogram for mercury .aeroelastic problems in connection with high speedreview is given of developments
in the field of aeroelasticity during the
past ten yearsthe effect of steadily increasing
mach number has been two-fold ..  on
the one hand the aerodynamic derivatives have
changed, and in some cases brought new
problems, and on the other hand the design for
higher mach numbers has led to thinner
aerofoils and more slender fuselages for which
the required stiffness is more difficult to
provideboth these aspects are discussed,
and various methods of attack on the
problems are consideredthe relative merits
of stiffness, damping and massbalance
for the prevention of control surface flutter are
discusseda brief mention is made of
the recent problems of damage from jet efflux
and of the possible aeroelastic effects
of kinetic heating .bodt freedom flutter of ground launched rocket modelstheoretical investigation of symmetric
body freedom flutter ofrocket model is describedthe results
confirm that structural failures of models were caused
by this type of flutter, and an extension of the investigation
indicates the parameters that are of importancea high
ratio of body to wing mass andwell forward position of the
overall centre of gravity are conditions under which flutter
may occurincrease of body pitching radius of gyration
and tailplane volume are beneficialit is concluded that this type of flutter may be significant
in some aircraft designs, and that the canard has no
advantage in this respect over the conventional lay-out of wing
and tailplane .subsonic aerodynamic flutter derivatives for wings and control surfaces,

the report describes tests to obtain direct
measurements of the aerodynamic effects of aspect ratio and
sweepback on wing flutterthe tests were made on rigid
wings with root flexibilitiesit is shown that measured effects of aspect ratio and
sweepback on the flutter of these wings can be represented
quite closely in flutter calculations based on two-dimensional
flow theory by multiplying the two-dimensional aerodynamic
coefficients by appropriate factorsthe effect of
sweepback is represented by multiplying all aerodynamic
coefficients by cos, where is the wing leading-edge
sweepback, and the effect of aspect ratio is represented by
multiplying the aerodynamic damping coefficients by 1f(a) and,
the stiffness coefficients by 1(f(a)) whereis the
aspect ratiofor the wings tested an average value for
f(a) is f(a)(1(0.8a)) .transonic flow in two dimensional and axially symmetrical

some observations of the effects of
end plates on the three-dimensional
separated flow at the ends of
cylindrical modelswhile these are
by no means exhaustive, it is felt
that they are of sufficient interest
to merit putting on record .slender not-so-thin wing theorya method for making an approximate thickness correction to slender
thin-wing theory is presentedthe method is tested by applying it to
cones with rhombic cross-sections and the agreement is found to be good
if the cones are not too thickit is then suggested that the
thickness correction to slender thin-wing theory may be applied
unchanged to linear thin-wing theorythis suggestion is compared with
some experiments on delta wings and it is found that there is considerable
improvement over thin-wing theory near the centre line, but that
this improvement is not maintained as the wing tips are approached .development ofquasi-steady approach to flutter and
the quasi-steady approach to flutter utilizes experimental or
theoretical steady-state aerodynamic data to arrive at increased
understanding of the flutter mechanism, and also, in many cases,
acceptably accurate quantitative flutter predictionscirculation
lag effects are neglected, but aerodynamic damping is included
in the evaluation of the air forcessituations requiring
the inclusion of rate aerodynamics for accurate flutter estimation
are specifieda quasi-unsteady approach is also discussed, in which the
approximate magnitude of the circulation lag function at flutter
is included in simple modifications of quasi-steady parametersclosed-form solutions are derived for the flutter characteristics
oftypical section with and without rate aerodynamicsapplication
is then made to the rational flutter analysis of threedimensional
multi-degree-of-freedom lifting surfacesa specific planform is evaluated in the mach-number range
from zero to twoquasi-steady, quasi-unsteady, and kernelfunction
results are compared subsonicallyquasi-steady results
are utilized supersonicallyprimary applications of the quasi-steady approach are in the
areas of preliminary design and parameter-variation studies,
modification of more sophisticated flutter theories to force compatibility
with available steady-state data, and flutter evaluation
of complex configurations which can be rationally analyzed by
steady-state aerodynamic theories, but for which no complete
unsteady aerodynamic theories are presently available .heat transfer through laminar boundary layers on semiinfinite
this paper shows how to calculate the rate of heat transfer
throughlaminar boundary layer onsemi-infinite cylinder of
arbitrary cross sectionthe cylinder is placed instream of
incompressible fluid, the flow at infinity being parallel to the
generators, and is maintained atuniform temperaturea
series solution for small downstream distances and an asymptotic
formula for large downstream distances are givento cover
the intermediate range an approximate pohlhausen solution is
obtained,.correction of the error involved in the pohlhausen
solution is suggested which, it is believed, will lead to final errors
of at mostpercentthe calculations are applied to elliptic
cylinders, and illustrate the effect on the local rate of heat transfer
of varying the ratio of the major and minor axes of cross section,
the length of perimeter being held fixed .oscillatory derivative measurements on sting-mounted

respect to angular displacements and velocities in pitch and yaw have
been measured satisfactorily, and results are given of tests oncambered ogee wing at six mach numbers from 0.2 to 2.6some tests

are included .further comments on the inversion of large structural matricesinrecent note, klein referred topaper co-authored by the writer,
and to ref..  regarding the subject of inversion of large-order
matrices, klein stated that he would show 'that the situation is not as
hopeless as the anove-mentioned authors intimate'the purpose of this note is not to take exception to klein/s
conclusions, but rather to disagree with his implication that the
authors of ref.were pessimistic with respect to large-matrix
inversionstwo general methods of analysis were treated..  the
method of consistent distortion and the method of transfer matricesthe first method leads directly torelatively large matrix of
structural coefficients of both internal forces and displacementsthis matrix must be inverted to solve the problemthe second method
ultimately producesrelatively small matrix requiring inversion.,
however, to arrive at this point one must performnumber of matrix
multiplications .an investigation of the flow aboutplane half-wingstudy has been made of the flow development
over the wing as the incidence and stream
mach number vary and this is illustrated by surface pressure
distributions and oil-flow patternsthe growth
and movement of the two main surface shocks (the rear and
forward shocks) is discussed, and conditions for
flow separation through these shocks are consideredfor
the rear shock, which has little sweep, these
conditions are similar to those for shock-induced separation
on two-dimensional aerofoilsthe forward
shock is comparatively highly swept and separation seems
to correspond to two rather different but
simultaneously-attained conditions, one related to the
component mach number normal to the shock front
and the other to the position of the reattachment linethe flow in the region between the leading edge and
the forward shock is shown to have certain characteristics
analogous to those found upstream of the shock on
two-dimensional aerofoilsto the rear of the forward
shock, but ahead of the rear shock, the flow at low
supersonic speeds resembles in some respects that aboutsimple conethe general flow development is related in the
text to the wing lift and pitching moment, and the dragthe first two are most affected by the aft movement
of the rear shock, which also stimulates the transonic
drag risethe lift-dependent drag is shown to be
influenced by the appearance of leading-edge separation
and possibly also by some stage in the development
of the forward shockthe flow over the cropped-delta planform is
noteworthy for the absence of the strong outboard shock
and this is attributed partly to the cropped tip and
partly to the unswept trailing edgea comparison is made
with results obtained during preliminary tests in
which the wing planform closely resembled that oftrue
delta .the lower bound of attainable sonic-boom over-pressure
fromstudy of existing sonic-boom
theory it has been possible to establish
an approximate lower bound of attainable
sonic-boom overpressure, which depends
only on the airplane length, weight, and
volume and on the flight conditionsthis lower bound may be approached overnarrow range of flight conditions
through the application of appropriate
design considerationsin general, for
intermediate values of lift coefficient
the major portion of the lift generating
surfaces must be located aft of the
maximum cross-sectional area, whereas for
higher values of lift coefficient
the maximum area must be well forward and or
the lift-producing surfaces must extend well toward the airplane nose .stability investigation ofblunted cone andbluntedcone withblunt nose tip andblunt nose tip and20 flared cylinder

an analytical and experimental study is made for inelastic
instability of initially imperfect cylindrical shells subject to
axial compressiondonnell's equations and the principle of
virtual work are adapted to determine the effects of initial
imperfections on the buckling modes and the critical buckling
stressesthe deformation theory and the incremental theory
of plastic stress-strain relationships are both consideredthe
experimental results of ten tests on specimens made of aluminum
alloy 3003-0 are presentedcomparison of experimental with
theoretical results indicates that the application of the deformation
theory providesfairly accurate prediction of buckling
strength, but fails in this case to yieldcorrect description of
post-buckling behavioron the other hand, the application of
the incremental theory, which is mathematically and physically
more rigorous, leads to an overestimation of buckling strength,
even though initial imperfections are consideredthis paradox
has existed for years, and remains to be resolved .buckling of sandwich under normal pressurea theoretical study is made of the buckling ofsandwich sphere

the effect of internal pressure on the small-deflection buckling
of thin-walled cylinders under bending is investigated by means
ofmodified donnell equationthe results indicate that the
maximum critical stress due to bending increases with internal
pressure, unlike the case of pressurized cylinders under compressionthese results represent the moment at which significant
deformations appear in the cylinder, rather than the maximum
moment able to be carried, but may begood approximation
to the latter for metal cylinders .breathing vibrations ofcircular shell with an internal
resonant breathing frequencies and mode shapes are determined
experimentally forthin-walled, circular cylindrical shell
containingnonviscous incompressible liquidthe resonant
frequencies determined for the full shell are in good agreement
with those predicted by reissner's shallow-shell vibration theory
with the inclusion of an apparent-mass term for the liquidthe
effect of the internal liquid on the shell mode shapes is significant
only for the partially full shellin this case the circumferential
node lines tend to shift toward the bottom or filled portion of the
shellexcitation of low-frequency liquid-sloshing motion by highfrequency
forced oscillation ofpartially filled shell occurred in
many casesthis low-frequency liquid response is tentatively
explained as being excited bybeat frequency in the forced
oscillationa similar type of response has been reported by
yarymovych in axially excited rigid tanks .clamped short oval cylindrical shells under hydrostatic
the principle of the minimum of the total potential is employed
to obtain stresses and displacements for clamped, short,
oval cylindrical shells under hydrostatic pressureclassical
shell theory, in which buckling effects are not considered, was
useda fourier series is assumed for the deflections in the
closed circumferential direction so that the partial differential

control of flow separation by fluid injection at one diverging
boundary oftwo-dimensional, transparent-walled de laval
nozzle was investigated by spark schlieren photography of dry
nitrogen flows expanded from two stagnation temperatures
injection conditions at the permeable boundary were varied by
the use of three grades of porous stainless steel with nominal pore
diameters of 10, 20, and 30 microns, through which nitrogen was
forced by coolant reservoir pressures of 25, 50, and 100 psig, in
addition to the case of no forced injectionpressure distribution
measurements were made along the nonpermeable diverging
boundaryit was found that flow separation at expansion ratios
approaching the optimum value for maximum thrust coefficient
could be induced at the porous wall bylocal injection mass
velocity of the order offew per cent of the local main-stream
mass velocityseparation at the solid boundary was not
noticeably influenced by injection at the opposite wall, and the
asymmetrical separation thus effected jet deflections of up to 10
degrees at the lower stagnation-pressure levelsvariation of the
wall heat-transfer condition by changing the stagnation temperature
did not significantly influence separation behaviortemperature
measurements at the reservoir face of the porous section,
together with use of published correlations and of the rubesin
analysis for estimation of stream-side stanton numbers under
noninjection and injection conditions, respectively, permitted
heat-transfer calculations which indicated that the effectiveness
of the transpiration technique in controlling nozzle wall temperatures
derives primarily from intimate fluid-solid contact inporous material of high specific surface .general characteristics of the flow through nozzles

.heat transfer through the laminar boundary layer on
this paper presentsmethod of calculating
the distribution of rate of heat transfer
intolaminar incompressible boundary layer
from the exterior surface oflong thin
circular cylinder, when the surface of the
cylinder is maintained atconstant temperature
and the flow is parallel to the
cylinder axis,. the temperature difference
between the surface and the main stream
is taken to be small enough to neglect
buoyancy effectsa series solution, valid
for small downstream distances from the
nose, has been obtained already by seban,
bond, and kellythis is now extended
by deriving an asymptotic series solution,
valid at large downstream distances, and
bridging the gap between these two series
solutions by an approximate solution,
based on the method used recently by davies
and bourne to calculate heat transfer
fromflat platethe calculation is used to
demonstrate the effect of curvature
and of prandtl number on the local rate of heat
transfer at various downstream
distances by comparing with the corresponding flat plate results .the flow of fluid along cylindersthe boundary layer equations for uniform flow parallel to the generators
 of any cylinder without corners are put into the form ofseries of
linear third-order differential equationsthe first three of these are
 the same as those obtained by seban and bond /1/ forcircular cylinder
and solved by kelly /2/the rest have additional terms depending
on the radius of curvature of the cylinder and its derivativesthe
 problem is also attacked bypohlhausen method as far as four terms of
 the seriesfor large distances from the front, rayleigh's method, as
given by hasimoto /3/, gives the first two terms of an asymptotic
expansion for the dragexplicit calculations are made of the drag of
an elliptic cylinder of eccentricity 1/2. there is evidence that the
drag is everywhere less than that ofcircular cylinder of the same
perimeter .the skin friction on infinite cylinders moving parallell to their length
the frictional force oncylinder moving steadily parallel to its
length throughviscous liquid which is initially at rest is determined
 with reasonable accuracy over the whole range of values of the duration
 of the motion and forwide variety of shapes of the cylinder crosssectionwhen the timeis small, the first approximation givesforce per unit area which is the same as that forflat plate of infinite
widththe second approximation takes the shape of the cylinder
into account and the force on unit length of cylinder is determined in
terms of the number of corners, and their angles, in the cylinder cross
linder is the same, to this approximation, as that oncircular cylinder
of the same perimeterfor large values ofthe determination of
the frictional force is reducible to that ofpotential problem, the
solution of which is known fornumber of different shapesthe
approximations for small and large values offor any one cylinder do
not overlap but can be joined without much ambiguityfor no value ofdo the forces on cylinders of different shape /excluding those whose
curvature is not everywhere inwards/ differ by more than about 25 per
cent .rayleigh's problem forcylinder of arbitrary shapethe motion of an incompressible viscous fluid generated bycylinder of
 arbitrary cross-sectional form which is started to move suddenly from
rest with uniform velocity in the direction of its length is considered
 formulae in powers of are derived for the velocity distribution /valid
in the vicinity of the cylinder/ and for the frictional drag on the cylinder,
correct to the order of a, whereis the characteristic length
of the cross section,is the kinematic viscosity, andis the timethese formulae are given in terms of only the analytic function which
maps conformally the region outside the cross section of the cylinder
onto the region outside the unit circle, and of certain integralswhich are common to any arbitrary cylinderin particular, whenis
sufficiently small, the total frictional drag on the cylinder per unit
length is expressed as, irrespective of the cross-sectional form, where2 and0.5772.../euler's constant/ .an approximate boundary layer theory for semi-infinite cylinders of
an estimate is given of the distribution of skin frictional force per
unit length, and of displacement area, on the outside ofsemi-infinite
 cylinder, of arbitrary cross-section, moving steadily indirection
parallel to its generatorsa pohlhausen method is employed withvelocity distribution chosen to yield zero viscous retarding force on
the boundary layer approximations/the smallness of the fluid
acceleration far from the leading edge has been pointed out by batchelor
reasonable results atlarge distances from the leading edgehowever,
forlarge class of cross-sections, which includes all convex crosssections
and locally concave cross-sections with re-entrant angles
greater than 1/2, the method yields the expected square root growth of
the boundary layer at the leading-edge, withfairly close approximation
to the coefficient, and it is supposed that the skin-frictional
force and displacement area are given with reasonable accuracy along the
 whole length of the cylinderresults for the elliptic cylinder and the finite flat plate are given in
 closed form, valid for the whole length of the cylinder, and are expected
to be in error by at most 20 per centin addition, some estimate
is given of the effect of corners on skin frictional force and
displacement area .a further note on the calculation of heat transfer
by usingkarman-pohlhausen method
the distribution of local rate of heat
transfer is ovaluated for the case of air flow
in an axisymmetrical laminar boundary
layer onheated circular cylinder, the temperature
of the cylinder being independent
of downstream distancethis calculation
serves to link the numerical values
obtained by seban, bond, and kelly
for small downstream distances to those obtained
by bourne and davies for large
downstream distances .a wind-tunnel test technique for measuring the dynamic rotarymethod is described for measuring the dynamic stability derivatives
ofmodel airplane inwind tunnelthe characteristic features
of this system are that single-degree-of-freedom oscillations were
used to obtain combinations of rolling, yawing and pitching motions.,
that the oscillations were excited and controlled by velocity feedback
which permitted operation under conditions unfavorable for more
conventional types of oscillatory testing., and that data processing was
greatly simplified by using analog computer elements in the strain-gage
circuitrythe system described is primarily for measurement of the damping
derivatives damping
in roll damping in pitch, damping in yaw, and the cross derivatives
rolling moment due to yawing and yawing moment due to rollingthe
method of testing also permits measurement under oscillatory conditions
of the static derivatives rolling moment due to sideslip, yawing moment
due to sideslip, and pitching moment due to angle of attackall these
derivatives are of particular importance in estimating the short-period
oscillatory motions ofrigid airplanea small number of experimental data are included to illustrate the
general scope of results obtainable with this system .measurements at mach numbers up to 2.of the longitudinal

measurements of the zero-lift pressure

plane wingthe results have been analysed
to give data for estimating the
performance of supersonic transport aircraft .some low speed problems of high speed aircraftthe first part of the paper deals with the low speed aerodynamics of
aircraft shapes suggested by kuchemann, at the second international
congress in aeronautical sciences at zurich in 1960, as suitable for
achievingrequired range at supersonic speeds, namely wingbody
arrangements with sweepback angles of 55degrees or 60degrees and
streamwise thickness-chord ratio of aboutper cent suitable for low
supersonic speed, and slender near-triangular wings with sharp leading
edges suitable for mach numbers of aboutor moreno attention is given to /slewed/ wings, powered lift or variable geometryin dealing briefly with swept wings, the need for avoiding separation of
 flow from the leading edge is demonstrated, with the conclusion that it
 is desirable to use leading edge flaps with blowing or suction at the
knee together with blown trailing edge flapswind tunnel tests are
described onsimplified model with these boundary layer control
methods appliedmention is made of the possibility of adverse ground
effect on maximum liftmore attention is given to the case of slender wings because their use
involvesnew type of flow with separation from all edgesthis flow
and its steadiness are therefore discussed from the point of view of
the possibility of buffeting,. the effect of plan form on static
longitudinal stability and pitch-up is analysed,. andshort summary of
 available results on damping in pitch is givenlarge rolling moments
due to sideslip are shown to give rise to serious problems of control,
and the present state of knowledge of static lateral and directional
stability and rolling and yawing rotary derivatives is discussedfinally the effects of proximity to the ground are summarisedthe second part of the paper is concerned with work aimed at clarifying
some of the requirements for handling qualities of future aircraftit
is not so much concerned with forecasts of the dynamic behaviour of
these future aircraft as with determining what the pilot wantstwo aspects of control in the vertical plane are discussed in some
detail namely speed control and glide path holdingflight tests on an
avro 707a aircraft, with artificially worsened characteristics, are described,
and it is shown that substantially constant performance in the
piloting task can be achieved at the expense of increased pilot effortsome tentative conclusions on desirable levels of speed stability and
phugoid damping are, nevertheless, drawna brief review of the present status of lateral/directional handling
requirements, using mainly american data, is also included .the flow pattern ontapered sweptback wing at mach numbers between 0.6

smoothly fromsubsonic type involving leading-edge separation tosupersonic type where the flow is attached near the leading edge and
with shock-induced separation further aftthe formation and movement
of the shock-wave system and the vortices near the wing surface are
briefly discussed .experiments withtapered swept-back wing of warren 12 planform at mach

in relation to the flow development in this part of the reportthe wing was tested at mach numbers between6 and6 for incidences
up to about 14 degthe tunnel stagnation pressure was held constant atvalue near atmospheric pressure during the tests, so that the reynolds

 mean aerodynamic chordboundary-layer transition was fixed byroughness band at the leading edgea detailed analysis has been made of the pressure distributions on the
surface of the wing and the chordwise distributions integrated to
determine the spanwise loadingthe overall lift and pitching moment of
 the wing were also obtained from these data, as well as from direct
measurements usingstrain-gauge balance, by means of which the wing
drag was also determinedthese results are considered in some detail
to illustrate the effects of mach number and incidence on the flow about
 the modela preliminary analysis is also made of the conditions for
boundary-layer separation due to shock waves on the wing surfacethe
principal factor appears to be the component of mach number normal to
the shock front .the operation of the npl 18in14in. wind tunnel in the transonic speedbrief description of the slotted liners used is given together with
the power requirements and some flow surveyssome observations are made on wall interference onhalf-model ofswept wing tested in the wind tunnel .an investigation at transonic speeds of the performance of various
distributed roughness bands of no.320 and no.500 carborundum were found
to be effective in causing boundary-layer transition if they extended

presence of any of the roughness bands tested, but this result would not
 of course necessarily apply to wings of other planforms or section
shapesthe test reynolds number was about 2.7 millionin the appendix, the structure of the roughness bands is discussed, as
well as the details of the materials used and the techniques used to
apply the band .a study of the effect of leading-edge modifications on the flow over
summaryan investigation has been made in the n.p.l. 18 in.14 intunnel of the effects of leading-edge modifications on the flow and
forces on an untapered wing of 50 deg leading-edge sweep, at stream mach
 numbers between60 and20seven leading-edge profiles were
tested, ranging fromdrooped extension of 18 per cent of the chord of
the basic sharp-nosed section toround-nosed section withleadingedge
radius of0 per cent of the basic chordleading-edge droop was found to increase the wing drag near zero lift
but to reduce appreciably the lift-dependent drag component, except at
the highest test mach numbersdroop also increased the lift coefficient
at which leading-edge separation occurred on the upper surface
at moderate subsonic speeds, but in addition reduced the mach number for
 transonic flow attachmentthe appearance of the forward shock /but
not the rear shock/ is considerably delayed when the leading edge is
droopedwith the undrooped sections an increase in leading-edge radius was
accompanied by successively earlier appearances of the forward shock,
and hence the outboard shock with its attendant separationthe conditions
at which the rear shock first appeared changed only slowly as the
section was changedthe variations in wing flow pattern as the leading edge is modified are
discussed and related to measured changes in the wing lift and dragan attempt is also made to estimate the local mach numbers on some parts
 of the wing from the oil-flow patterns,. this material is used to
assess the flow conditions appropriate to shock-induced separationthe main section of the report concludes withtentative discussion of
the significance of the present results to the design of swept wingsin an appendix results obtained with the wing insweptforward configuration
are briefly considered .interaction between shock waves and boundary layers, withnote on the
the interaction between shock waves and boundary layers has important
effects in many problems of high-speed flowthis paper has been written
asguide to the literature on the subject, and ascritical
review of the present state of knowledge concerning both the underlying
physical processes and the practical applicationsit will be clear to
the reader that, although substantial progress has been made, our knowledge
is still far from complete and that more work both offundamental
nature and on specific applications is needed before the problem
is understood sufficiently well for design purposespartof the paper describes experiments on comparatively simple types
of flow designed to provide fundamental information and to assist in the
 development of the theorythese experiments show that the interaction
 depends mainly on the mach and reynolds numbers and on the strength of
the shock wavein particular, the interaction ofshock wave withlaminar boundary layer is shown to produce much larger effects than if
the boundary layer is turbulentfor most cases where the effects of
the interaction are large enough to have serious practical consequences
it is found that the boundary layer separates from the surface, and the
difference between the interaction with laminar and turbulent layers
arises mainly because the laminar layer separates much more readily in
an adverse pressure gradientthe details of the interaction downstream
 of the separation point thus depend critically on the behaviour of the
separated layer, and on the conditions under which it reattaches to the
surfacemany of the features found in the fundamental experiments appear also in
 practical applications and these are considered in parts ii and iii of
the paperalthough the emphasis hero is on the performance of aerfoils
and wings moving at high subsonic speeds, the importance of the
interaction in other examples such as at supersonic trailing edges and
in supersonic intakes is also discussed brieflythe differences between
the interaction with laminar and turbulent boundary layers are
oftensource of serious discrepancy between model experiments and
full-scale conditionsfor small-scale models it is, therefore, frequently
essential to make the boundary layer turbulent by artificial
meanssome of the difficulties involved in doing this, and certain of
the more promising methods are briefly discussedit is shown that
experiments on models with transition fixed can be used to explainnumber of aerodynamic effects encountered in transonic flight, and
connected with the occurrence of shock-induced separation of the turbulent
boundary layersfor both two-dimensional aerofoils and straight
 and sweptback wings, turbulent separation occurs for shocks abovecertain strength which applies for both model and full-scale conditions
full-scale conditions,. differences in magnitude would be expected if
the pressure recovery along the separated layer between the shock and
the trailing edge is affected by reynolds number, but little information
 is at present available on this pointmost of the repercussions of turbulent separation on the steady-motion
characteristics of aerofoils and wings can be traced to the associated
reduction in the pressure recovery over the roar of the surfacethis
is because the pressure at the trailing edge controls the inter-relation
 between the two surfaces /so long as the flow at the trailing edge
remains subsonic/, and in particular the relative movements of the shock
 waves and the extents of the local regions of supersonic flowcertain
 unsteady-flow characteristics such as buffeting and control surface
separationsome evidence is presented on the influence of section shape on the
occurrence and effects of separation, but in this, as in many other
respects, information relevant to turbulent boundary layers is scarcesome notes on the further work which is required are given in part iv of
 the paper .some effects of wind-tunnel interference observed in tests on twodimensional
in the high-speed research on two-dimensional aerofoils at the national
physical laboratory the need to keep model size abovecertain minimum,
 in order to reproduce correctly the boundary layer separation effects
experienced at full scale, has been considered paramount even at the
risk of incurring significant tunnel interference effectsthis report discusses the interference effects for the slotted working
sections now in usethe magnitudes of the blockage and lift effect
corrections are deduced for the ratio of model chord to tunnel height
normally usedit is shown thatsimple adaptation to reduce the open
area of the walls would reduce both corrections to insignificant proportions
simultaneously, but would givereduced choking mach number
separated flowsthe observed trends in the variation of the blockage
effects for other ratios of model chord to tunnel height differ from
those predicted theoretically, and so the results cannot be applied more
 generally until these trends have been checked by further investigationsit is suggested that wake interference effects can significantly influence
the manner in which separated flows develop with increasing
incidence or mach number, particularly for walls of small open areaexamples are also given of effects of distortions in the local supersonic
flow, which are most noticeable for walls with relatively large
open areas .wall interference at transonic speeds onhemisphere cylinder modeltests have been made in three n.p.l. wind tunnels onpressure-plotting
 model consisting oflong cylinder withhemispherical nosethe
surface pressure distributions were measured for stream mach numbers
between 0.7 and 1.1 at zero model incidence, and schlieren photographs
were takenthe blockage ratios were 0.211(, 0.117( and 0.120(the principal feature of the flow is the effect of working section size
on the rate at which the terminal shock wave moves back along the model
with increasing stream mach numberthis is thought to depend mainly
on the distance from the model to the slotted walls of the tunnel,
and not necessarily on the blockage ratiothe distance of the solid
sidewall is important in influencing the local mach number ahead of the
terminal shock, by reflecting the expansion-wave system originating near
 the model nose .experimental study of the equivalence of transonic
this report describes an experimental investigation of the equivalence
relationship and the related theory for lifting forces proposed by transonic
slender-body theorythe models chosen for this study areflat, winglike, elliptic cone-cylinder and its equivalent body of
revolution,circular cone-cylinderit is determined that the flows
about the two models are closely related in the manner predicted by the
theory, the relationship persisting overmach number range of 0.92 to
cone-cylinder vary linearly only over the small angle-of-attack range of
approximatelyand that the aerodynamic loading at sonic speed compares
favorably with jones' slender-wing theorythe results of the investigation suggest that at transonic speeds and
at small angles of attack the calculation of all aerodynamic
characteristics of slender, three-dimensional shapes can be made by use
of transonic slender-body theory when the pressures on the equivalent
body of revolution are known, either by experiment, or by an adequate
nonlinear theoryfrom transonic slender-body theory it is deduced
that the slenderness required for this application is the same as that
required for the successful application of the transonic area rule .the behaviour of supersonic flow pastbody of revolutiontheory is developed of the supersonic flow pastbody of revolution
at large distances from the axis, wherelinearized approximation is
valueless owing to the divergence of the characteristics at infinityit is used to find the asymptotic forms of the equations of the shocks
which are formed from the neighbourhoods of the nose and tailin the
special case ofslender pointed body, the general theory at large
distances is used to modify the linearized approximation to givetheory which is uniformly valid at all distances from the axisthe
results which are of physical importance are summarized in the
conclusion (9) and compared with the results of experimental
observations .the shock pattern ofwing-body combination far from
the position and strength of the front shock wave at large
distances fromwing-body combination, are deduced from the linear
theory for the combination, usingmethod developed by whithamthe
combination consists ofbody of revolution andwing which has
thickness and is liftingthe effects of interference between the flow
over the body and the flow over the wing are includedin any
direction the flow far from the wing-body combination is equivalent to
the flow pastbody of revolution determined from the configuration of
the combinationthe modified formulae for unsteady flow are given and
some results are evaluated for the combination ofbody of revolution
anddelta wing with subsonic leading edges .a flight test investigation of the sonic boomthe /sonic boom/ as it is now popularly called, has become the
center of considerable interest during the past few years because of
widespread public disturbance and possible damage that can result
from itin the hopes of minimizing this disturbance and to extend
the general knowledge of the shock waves which produce the booming
noise, the aeronautical research laboratory, wright air development
center, has initiated an extensive research program to study the sonic
boom phenomenonthis report presents the results of flight tests undertaken as one
phase of this programthe tests had as their objective the determination
and measurement of the shock wave pressure pattern surrounding
an f-100 aircraft in level supersonic flightthe flight tests were conducted at the air force flight test center,
edwards air force base, california, under the authority of air
research and development command test directive no. 5524-f1 .ground measurements of the shock wave noise from airplanes
time histories of noise pressures near ground level were measured
during flight tests of fighter-type airplanes over fairly flat, partly
wooded terrain in the mach number range between 1.13 and 1.4 and at
altitudes from 25,000 to 45,000 feetatmospheric soundings and radartracking
studies were made for correlation with the measured noise
datathe measured and calculated values of the pressure rise across the
shock wave were generally in good agreementthere istendency for
the theory to overestimate the pressure at locations remote from the
track and to underestimate the pressures for conditions of high tailwind
at altitudethe measured values of ground-reflection factor averaged
about 1.8 for the surfaces tested as compared totheoretical value
of 2.0two booms were measured in all casesthe observers also
generally reported two booms,. although, in some cases, only one boom
was reportedthe shock-wave noise associated with some of the flight
tests was judged to be objectionable by ground observers, and in one
case the cracking ofplate-glass store window was correlated in time
with the passage of the airplane at an altitude of 25,000 feet .ground measurements of airplane shock wave noise at
the intensity of shock-wave noise at the ground resulting from
flights at mach numbers to 2.0 and altitudes to 60,000 feet was
measuredmeasurements near the ground track for flights ofsupersonic fighter and one flight ofsupersonic bomber are presentedlevel cruising flight at an altitude of 60,000 feet andmach
number of 2.0 produced sonic booms which were considered to be
tolerable, and it is reasonable to expect that cruising flight at higher
altitudes will produce booms of tolerable intensity for airplanes of the
size and weight of the test airplanesthe measured variation of
sonic-boom intensity with altitude was in good agreement with the
variation calculated by an equation given in nasa technical note d-48the effect of mach number on the ground overpressure is small between
mach numbers of 1.4 and 2.0,result in agreement with the theoryno
amplification of the shock-wave overpressures due to refraction effects
was apparent near the cutoff mach numbera method for estimating the effect of flight-path angle on cutoff
mach number is shownexperimental results indicate agreement with the
method, sinceclimb maneuver produced booms ofmuch decreased intensity
as compared with the intensity of those measured in level flight at
about the same altitude and mach numbercomparison of sound pressure levels for the fighter and bomber airplanes
indicated little effect of either airplane size or weight at an
altitude of 40,000 feet .ground measurements of the shock wave noise from supersonic
shock-wave ground-pressure measurements
have been made for supersonic
bomber airplanes in the mach number
range from 1.24 to 1.52, for
altitudes from about 30,000 to 50,000 feet,
and forgross-weight range
from about 83,000 to 120,000 poundsthe
measured overpressures were
generally higher than would be predicted
by the theory which accounts
only for volume effectsthere is thussuggestion that lift effects
on sonic-boom intensity may be significant
for this type of airplane
for the altitude range of the present tests .an investigation of some aspects of the sonic boom
an investigation of some aspects
of the sonic boom has been made
with the aid of wind-tunnel measurements
of the pressure distributions
about bodies of various shapesthe
tests were made in the langley
atmach number of 2.01 and
atreynolds number per foot of 2.510measurements of the pressure
field were made at orifices in the surface
ofboundary-layer bypass
platethe models which represented both
fuselage and wing types of
thickness distributions were small enough
to allow measurements as far
away asbody lengths or 64 chordsthe
results are compared with
estimates made using existing theoryto the first order, the boom-producing
pressure rise across the bow
shock is dependent on the longitudinal
development of body area and not
on local detailsnonaxisymmetrical shapes
may be replaced by equivalent
bodies of revolution to obtain satisfactory
theoretical estimates
of the far-field pressures .an investigation of the influence of lift on sonic-boom
an investigation of the effect
of lift on sonic-boom intensity has
been performed by means of wind-tunnel
measurements of the pressure fields
surrounding small wing-body combinationsthe tests were conducted in
the langley 4- by 4-foot supersonic
pressure tunnel atmach number of
per footeffects of lift were
found to be real and significantmeasured bow-shock intensities agreed
fairly well with, but were consistently
less than, shock intensities
estimated by theoretical methodsavailable flight data were examined
for correlation with wind-tunnel test
results .the shock wave noise problem of supersonic aircraft
data are presented which provide
an insight into the nature of the
shock-wave noise problem, the significant
variables involved, and the
manner in which airplane operation
may be affectedflight-test data
are also given, andcomparison with
the available theory is madean
attempt is also made to correlate the
subjective reactions of observers
and some associated physical phenomena
with the pressure amplitudes
during full-scale flightit is indicated that for the proposed
supersonic transport airplanes
of the future, booms on the ground will
most probably be experienced
during the major portion of the flight
planthe boom pressures will be
most severe during the climb and descent
phases of the flight planduring the cruise phase of the flight,
the boom pressures are of much
lesser intensity but are spread laterally
for many milesthe manner
in which the airplane is operated appears
to be significant,. for example,
the boom pressures during the climb,
cruise, and descent phases can be
minimized by operating the airplane at
its maximum altitude consistent
with its performance capabilities .an investigation of lifting effects on the intensity
this paper isbrief summary of
an investigation made to check the effect of lift
on the shock noise of aircraft flying at supersonic
speedsthe method of hayes has been
combined with the theory of whitham to
predict the asymptotic shock strength of wings
carrying lift and of combinations of bodies
and lifting wings(a similar, but not quite as
general, method was derived by walkden in
ref..)  whitham's formula, including only the
volume term, has been used extensively to predict
the boom intensity of aeroplane type bodies
and the agreement with experiment has, so far,
been quite reasonablethe test data obtained
to date extends only up to about 40,000 ft.
altitude and the calculations of this paper show
that under those conditions the shock noise of
the aircraft tested so far will, in most cases,
be dominated by the volume termit is shown
that at higher altitudes lifting effects will
dominate for even the small fighter and they will
dominate over most of the altitude range
for large bomber and supersonic transport
aircraftthe boom intensity due to lift decreases
with altitude as which compares to
in the volume case (=pressure at
altitude h)it is insensitive to mach number,
wing loading, wing plan shape and
lift distributiona simple rule for calculating
the shock noise due to combined volume and
lifting effects is proposed which is applicable to
configurations with wings located towards the
rear of the fuselagethe rule states that the shock
noise of an aircraft carrying lift is equal
to the shock noise due to volume (neglecting lift)
or the shock noise due to lift (neglecting
volume), whichever is the greatera chart is
presented from which rapid estimates can be
made of the shock noise of lifting
wing-body combinations .investigation of two bluff shapes in axial free flightfineness-ratio-2.71 right circular cylinder andfineness-ratiobeen
tested in free flight overmach number range of 0.35 to 2.15 andreynolds number range ofx 10 to 1210time histories, cross
plots of force coefficients, rolling velocity, and longitudinal-force
coefficient are presented for both cylindersin addition, cross plots
of moment coefficients and plots of the normal-force curve slope and
the aerodynamic center are presented for the fineness-ratio-2.71
cylinderthe average aerodynamic center of the right circular
cylinder moved rearward with decreasing speeds until at the subsonic
mach numbers it remained approximately constant and comparisons of the
drag data of this test with wind tunnel and other free-flight data show
good agreementan appreciable decrease in drag was observed when the
data of the present test of the rounded nose cylinder were compared with
data ofright circular cylinder ofsimilar configuration .the motion of rolling symmetrical missiles referred
the linearized equations of motion have been derived forrolling
missile having slight aerodynamic asymmetriestime histories of
rolling-missile motions referred tobody-axis system have been prepared
to show the types of missile motions that can be encounteredthe motions resulting fromtrim change andpulse-rocket disturbance
are shown to be determined mainly by the ratio of rolling velocity to
pitching frequencyfinally, the derived equations are used in establishingtechnique
for the reduction of rolling-missile oscillation datait is shown
that the aerodynamic derivatives can be obtained from flight data if
four accelerations are measuredthe method is applied to the results
obtained fromflight test ofmissile configuration .stability derivatives of cones at supersonic speedsthe aerodynamic stability derivatives due to pitching velocity and
vertical acceleration are calculated by use of potential theory for circular
cones traveling at supersonic speedsthe analysis is based on
two theoretical techniques used successfully previously in application
to the case of uniform axial and inclined flowin the first,
potential solutions for axial flow and crossflow are derived from the
first-order wave equation but in application to calculations for the
forces no approximations are made either to the tangency condition or
to the isentropic pressure relationthe second method consists in
combining the first-order crossflow potential with an axial-flow
potential correct to second orderclosed-form solutions by both
methods are found forcone, and numerical results for the stability
derivatives are presented asfunction of mach number for cones having
semivertex angles of 10 and 20in addition, expressions for the forces, moments, and stability
derivatives of arbitrary bodies of revolution are obtained using
newtonian impact theorynumerical results for cones compare well
with those obtained from the combined first- and second-order potential
theory at the highest mach number for which the latter theory is
applicable .investigation of several blunt bodies to determine
several blunt bodies having shapes that may be suitable for atmospheric
reentry vehicles were tested to determine the aerodynamic characteristics
of such shapes for angles of attack up to 34the tests
were conducted through the transonic mach number range and at reynolds
numbers from 1.7410 to 2.7810, based on body diametera full-skirted rather thanshort-skirted type of shape developed
the greatest amount of static stability and the largest lift-curve
slopesthe angle of attack for maximum lift for such bodies appears
to be subject to mach number effectsspinningfull-skirted body
about its longitudinal axis generally increased the lift and reduced the
pitching moment at angles of attack and reduced the aerodynamic static
stability parameter through the transonic mach number rangethe extension
of segmented clamshell-shaped flaps from the afterbody ofshort-skirted model served to increase the lift and static stability
only if the flaps extended into the airstreamsome evidence was found of oscillatory base pressures on two dissimilar
shapes at certain high angles of attack and the highest mach
number in these teststhere is doubt, however, that these pressures
can induce any significant oscillatory motion forreentry vehicle
because of their small amplitude and phasing .experimental investigation atmach number of 3. 11number of blunt bodies having shapes that may be suitable for
atmospheric reentry were tested to determine the lift, drag, and
pitching-moment characteristics atmach number of 3.11 andreynolds
number ofx 10 based on maximum body diameter ofinchesthe results of the tests showed that all the bodies were statically
stable aboutpoint located one-third of the body length from the
nosethe results also showed that high-drag bodies which havelarge
portion of their afterbodies negatively sloped (decrease in crosssectional
area from nose to base) may havenegative lift-curve slopethis negative slope results from the large negative lift component of
the axial force obtained with those bodies and the fact that with
negatively sloped afterbodies only small normal forces are developed .loading paths and the incremental stress lawthis paper will be concerned with some properties of the
stress-strain law for work hardening materials introduced by w. prager
incremental strain or plastic flow law by which it is meant that the
differentials of strain are expressed as functions of the stresses,
strains, and differentials of the stresswe shall also have occasion
to refer to total strain or plastic deformation laws, in which the
strains are given directly as functions of the stress .a quantitative comparison of flow and deformation theories
the stresses and displacements inpartly plastic, infinitely
long, hollow cylinder are obtained according to the
flow type of stress-strain law of prandtl-reuss and to the
deformation law of henckyin both cases the mises yield
condition is used and the compressibility of the material is
taken into accountit is shown that under these assumptions
the two theories yield substantially the same results
for this particular problem, but that one theory or
the other may be preferable for computing purposes in
certain casesthe results are compared with those of
other investigations in which different combinations of
stress-strain law, yield condition, compressibility, and end
loading were assumed .stresses in the plastic range aroundnormally loaded
the stresses in the plastic range aroundnormally loaded circular hole
in an infinite sheet are found numerically on the basis of both
deformation and incremental theoriesthe results of deformation
theory are quantitatively assessed in the light ofcriterion, recently
developed by budiansky, for the acceptability of deformation theoriesthe criterion is completely satisfiedmoreover, the results obtained
by using these two different theories of plasticity do not differ
greatly despite the fact that the stress paths are far from being
radial .theories of plastic bucklingthe theory for the plastic buckling of columns which appears
finally to have achievedsatisfactory form, rests upon the wellestablished
uniaxial stress-strain relationthe development ofcorrespondingly satisfactory theory for the plastic buckling of
plates has been hampered by the nonexistence of an established
polyaxial stress-strain relation in the plastic rangepresent theories for the polyaxial stress-strain relation beyond
the elastic range can be divided into two types, often called flow
and deformation theoriestheories of plastic buckling based on
deformation theories are in better agreement with experiment
than those based on flow theorieson the other hand, tests in
whichmaterial is compressed into the plastic range and then
subjected to shear at constant compressive stress are in better
agreement with flow than with deformation theorieslegitimate
doubt therefore has existed as to the validity of any theory for
the plastic buckling of platesasresult of studying these apparent contradictions,new
theory of plasticity has been developed which is of neither the
flow nor the deformation typeit is based upon the concept of
slip, and its formulation was guided more by physical, and less
by mathematical, considerations than previous theoriesexperimental
evidence of limited scope but of crucial character is in
better agreement with the new theory than with either flow or
deformation theoriesthe new theory accounts for the apparent
contradictions previously alluded to and justifies the use of deformation
theory in the analysis of the plastic buckling of plates .inelastic column theorythe action ofcolumn in the plastic range is analyzed on the
basis that bending may proceed simultaneously with increasing
axial loadthis leads tonew column formula that includes
both the tangent-modulus (engesser) and the reduced-modulus
the tangent-modulus load and that the column load increases
with increasing lateral deflection, approaching the reducedmodulus
load aslimit if the tangent modulus is assumed to
remain constant .effects of imperfections on buckling of thin cylinders
von karman and tsien have shown that under elastic
conditions the resistance of perfect thin cylinders subjected
to axial compression drops precipitously after bucklingit is considered that this indicates that this type of
buckling is very sensitive to imperfections or disturbancesin this paper the effects of certain imperfections of shape
turbances combined) are studied by the large-deflection
shell theory developed inprevious paper (2)it is found that two types of buckling failure may occurone is ofpurely elastic type which occurs when the peak
of the average stress versus average strain curve is reached,
while the other type is precipitated by yielding, which for
thicker cylinders or lower-yield material may occur before
suchpeak is reachedcurves are derived giving the dependence
of each type of failure upon the dimensions and
elastic and yield properties of the specimen and also upon
an /unevenness factor/which determines the magnitude
of the initial imperfections and is assumed to depend
on the method of fabricationthe relations derived are in
line with test results, and similar studies of the buckling
of struts indicate that the magnitude of the initial imperfections
which have to be assumed to explain test strengths
are reasonable .plastic torsional buckling strength of cylinders including
the torsional buckling strength ofcylinder in the plastic
range has been determinedan energy solution andmore exact
solution, both based onplastic stress-strain relationship given
by the simple deformation theory, are presentedclose agreement
between the two solutions is foundthe effects of large
deflections and imperfections on buckling strength are analyzedfor two groups of experimental results used for comparison, the
effects of geometrical imperfections in the plastic range are
negligiblethe theoretical results are found to be in good agreement
with the experimental results .on the concept of stability of inelastic systemssimple models are employed to bring out the large and important
differences between buckling in the plastic range and
classical elastic instabilitystatic and kinetic criteria are compared
and their interrelation discussednonlinear behavior in
particular is often found to be the key to the physically valid
solutionthe nonconservative nature of plastic deformation in
itself or in combination with the nonlinearity requires concepts
not found in classical approachesconversely, the classical
linearized condition of neutral equilibrium is really not relevant
in inelastic bucklingplastic buckling loads are not uniquely
defined but coverrange of values and are often more properly
thought of as maximum loads for some reasonable initial imperfection
in geometry or dynamic disturbancethe models indicate that basically the same information is
obtained from essentially static systems by assuming initial imperfection
in geometric forms as by assuming dynamic disturbancesone approach complements the other and both are helpful
in obtaining an understanding of the physical phenomena .inelastic instability and incremental theories of plasticitya most troublesome paradox has existed fornumber of years
with respect to buckling in the plastic rangetheoretical considerations
and all direct experimental evidence show conclusively
that an incremental or flow type of mathematical theory
of plasticity is validhowever, the results of plastic buckling
tests are well correlated bysimple total or deformation theory
and bear no resemblance to published predictions of incremental
theorythe suggestion was made that initial imperfections of shape
or loading might well explain this most peculiar resulthowever,
subsequent investigations by several authors seem to have
given the impression that excessively large imperfections would
be needed and that the answer would be overly sensitive to the
magnitude of such imperfectionsit is the purpose of this paper to demonstrate that extremely
small, and therefore unavoidable, imperfections of shape do account
for the paradox insimple mannerthe buckling load is
shown to be extremely insensitive to the amount of imperfectionthe example chosen issimplified version of the long rectangular
plate hinged along one edge and free on the other under uniform
compressive stress at the endsthis is the equivalent of
the case of the cruciform column, which has been so disturbing
in the past because incremental theory applied toperfect cruciform
column did lead to an entirely incorrect result .small bending and stretching of sandwich type shellsa theory has been developed for small bending and stretching of
sandwich-type shellsthis theory is an extension of the known theory
of homogeneous thin elastic shellsit was found that two effects are
important in the present problem, which have not been considered
previously in the theory of curved shells ..  (1) the effect of transverse
shear deformation and (2) the effect of transverse normal stress
deformationthe first of these two effects has been known to be of
importance in the theory of plates and beamsthe second effect was
found to occur inmanner which is typical for shells and has no
counterpart in flat-plate theorythe general results of this report have been applied to the
solution of problems concerning flat plates, circular rings, circular
cylindrical shells, and spherical shellsin each case numerical
examples have been given, illustrating the magnitude of the effects
of transverse shear and normal stress deformationthe results of this investigation indicate the necessity of
taking account of transverse shear and normal stress in sandwich-type
shells, as soon as there is an order-of-magnitude difference between
the elastic constants of the core layer and of the face layers of the
composite shellit was found that the changes due to transverse
shear and normal stress deformation in the core may be so large as to
be no mere corrections to the results of the theory without transverse
core flexibilitythe actual magnitude of the changes is greatly dependent on the
geometry and loading condition of the structure under consideration
so that no general rules may be given which indicate for which elastic
modulus ratio the changes begin to be significantsolutions of problems in the present theory may in general be
obtained by mathematical methods which are similar to those employed
in the theory of plates and shells without the effect of transverse
shear and normal stress deformation includedthe present work does
not include consideration of buckling and finite deflection effects .a nonlinear theory of bending and buckling of thinshallow spherical dome subjected to lateral pressure isstructure
for which the deformation departs appreciably from the linear theory at
relatively small values of the deflection amplitudeit is also one
for which the buckling process is characterized byrapid decrease in
the equilibrium load once the buckling load has been surpassedfor
structures having this type of buckling characteristics the question
arises as to whether the proper buckling criterion to apply is the
classical criterion, which considers equilibrium with respect to
infinitesimal displacements, or the finite-displacement /energy
criterion/ proposed by tsienin this paper the problem of the finite displacement and buckling
ofshallow spherical dome is investigated both theoretically and
experimentallyin the theoretical approach the nonlinear equations
are converted intosequence of linear equations by expanding all of
the variables in powers of the center deflection and then equating the
coefficients of equal powersthe basic parameter for the shallow dome
is proportional to the ratio of the central height of the dometo its
thickness.  for small values of this ratio the expansions converge
rapidly and enough terms are computed to determine the buckling load
according to the classical criterionfor higher values oft, convergence
deteriorates rapidly and it was not possible to determine the
buckling load with the number of terms which were computedhowever
even for these higher values oft the deflection shapes are determined
for deflection amplitudes below the amplitude at which buckling occursthese deflection shapes are characterized by their rapid change ast
increases and by the fact that, over most of the range oft studied,
the maximum deflection does not occur at the center of the domeexperimental results seem to indicate that the classical criterion
of buckling is applicable to very shallow spherical domes for which the
theoretical calculation was madea transition to energy criterion for
higher domes is also indicated .stresses and small displacements of shallow spherical
the purpose of the present paper is to derivesystem of
equations which can be used for the analysis of shallow segments of
thin, elastic, spherical shellsa segment will be called shallow if
the ratio of its height to base diameter is less than, saythe
results obtained on the basis of this assumption will often also be
applicable to shells which are not shallow, namely then, when the loads
are such that the stresses are effectively restricted to shallow zonesthe problem of the spherical elastic shell has been the subject of
numerous researchesfor the rotationally symmetric case the
fundamental results were obtained in 1912 (1) and have been the starting
point of many applicationswhile it is possible to deduce from these
results approximate equations equivalent to part of what follows, it is
believed that the present approach to the problem of the shallow shell
may be of some interest even for rotationally symmetric casesa number of investigations have been concerned with the shell loaded
innon-rotationally symmetric manner (2,3,4)in its general form
this problem is quite difficult and the results so far obtained are not
easy to applyrestricting attention to the shallow shell in the
manner of the present paper brings with itvery considerable
simplification of the analysis .stability of thin-walled tubes under torsionin this papertheoretical solution is developed for the
torsion onround thin-walled tube for which the walls
become unstablethe results of this theory are given byfew simple formulas and curves which cover all casesthe differential equations of equilibrium are derived insimpler form than previously found, it being shown that
many items can be neglectedthe solution obtained is
length ratio is zero and infinite, and isgood approximation
for intermediate casesthe theory is compared
with all available experiments, including about 50 tests
made by the authorthe experimental-failure torque is
always smaller than the theoretical-buckling torque, averaging
about 75 percent of it, withminimum of 60 percentas the form of the deflection checks closely with
that predicted by theory and the experiments covergreat
range of shapes and materials, this discrepancy can reasonably
be ascribed largely to initial eccentricities in
actual tubes .nonlinear deflections of shallow spherical shellsthe equations obtained by chien for the nonlinear deflection
of shallow spherical shells under uniform external pressure are
solved by means of power series expansions, following procedures
introduced by friedrichs and stoker in their treatment of buckling
of circular platesthese equations depend upon two parametersone of these parameters is related to the external pressure,
while the other depends upon the dimensions of the shellthe equations are solved for several ranges of the parameters
under boundary conditions corresponding tofixed edgethe solution, carried out numerically on the aec univac
at new york university, yieldscomplete description of the
stresses and deflections as functions of the polar angle overwide range of values of the loading parameter and the dimensional
parameterprediction of the upper buckling load is then
made by means ofnumerical criterion based on the load vs.
deflection curvefor some cases, the postbuckling behavior
is investigatedthe results agree well with existing experimental
and theoretical studies and coverwide range of cases
not previously treated .buckling of shallow shells under external pressurea formula for the initial buckling loads for clamped, shallow spherical
shells under uniform external pressure is obtained by combining the
solutions of two linearized versions of the original nonlinear problemone of these versions islinear eigenvalue problem while the other is
the bending problem forshallow cap in the linear theory of
elasticitythe formula, which is obtained insimple manner, yields
buckling loads that are in better agreement with experiments than previous
approximate solutions to the nonlinear problem .accelerating convergence of iteration processesa technique is discussed which, when applied to an iterative procedure
for the solution of an equation, accelerates the rate of convergence if
the iteration converges and induces convergence if the iteration
divergesan illustrative example is given .a simple method of matric structural analysis, part
the method presented in the previous parts is employed to
solve various kinds of nonlinear problems, such as problems concerning
large deflections or buckling, or thermal creep, or inelastic
stress redistribution involving thermal gradients, or designthe procedure used in each case is one of direct iteration-i.

self-generatingsimple numerical examples are worked out .limit design for economical missile structuresa special safety factor alone won't do the trick in the design of
lightweight, high temperature missile structuresif you really want
to end up with the most efficient structure you can get, an entirely
new design approach is needed .the problem of strain accumulation under thermal cyclingparkes and sprague and huang have shown that it is possible for strain
growth to occur inbeam structure under temperature-load cyclingthe various aspects of this problem as to criteria for convergence and
divergence of the strain accumulation can be simply demonstrated by
thermal cycling one element oftwo-element structure .analytical and experimental investigation of stress distributions in

tureexperimental verification of the analytical procedures is shown with
comparisons between the use of constant room temperature or temperature
dependent values of modulus of elasticity and coefficient of thermal
expansionthe test specimen, equipment, instrumentation, and experimental program
are discussed in detailexperimental data obtained from the specimen
and associated material control coupon tests are presented .inelastic behaviour of structures subjected to cyclicgeneral analytical procedure is outlined for structures subjected to
varying thermal and mechanical stressing conditionsconsideration is
given to the accumulation of time-independent plastic strains and creep
strainsstress-strain-temperature-time relations for uniaxial and
multiaxial stresses are defined, based on various material behavior
assumptionsseveral of the assumptions are compared withlimited
number of time-varying temperature and uniaxial stress teststhe procedure is illustrated by its application to uniaxial stress
problems in which /planes originally plane remain plane/ and to plane
stress plate problemsa solution, based on the influence coefficient
approach to the plane stress plate problem, is obtained which is
applicable to all plate plan forms, edge boundary conditions, and
inplane thermal and mechanical loading conditionsfrom the predicted inelastic behavior ofthree-bar structure
subjected to cyclic thermal and mechanical loading conditions, it is
shown that eventual failure could result from large permanent deformation
accumulations, tensile rupture, or thermal-stress-fatiguea sample plate withcentrally located hole was analyzed for two
cycles oftime-varying temperature and edge stress conditionboth
plastic strain reversals and plastic strain growths were predicted at
the holehowever,test-theory comparison indicated failure by
creep-rupture .bending and compression tests of pressurised ring-stiffened
the results of tests on pressurized ring-stiffened cylinders subjected
to compression and bending are presented and discussedthe
results obtained at high values of internal pressure differ from those
obtained by previous investigators in that the theoretical smalldeflection
compressive buckling coefficient of 0.6 was nearly achieved
in each testsmall amounts of internal pressure hadgreater stabilizing
effect in the bending tests than in the compression tests .the bending stability of thin-- walled unstiffened
inrecent paper, the authors presentedstatistical, semiempirical
design procedure for the determination of the buckling
strength of unpressurized and pressurized cylinders under axial
compressionthis procedure has been extended in the present
paper to the bending of unpressurized and pressurized cylindrical
shells and allows the calculation of the critical bending stress withknowledge of the cylinder geometry and the internal pressure
onlybecause no published data could be found, an extensive series
of bending tests of pressurized cylinders has been performedthese new data for pressurized cylinders are treated semiempirically
together with all of the other known test data for unpressurized
cylindersbest-fit curves are presented using applicable
theoretical parametersdesign curves for determining the
critical buckling stress for unpressurized and pressurized cylinders
in bending are then developed as 90 per cent probability curves
from the test data .analysis of partly wrinkled membranea theory is derived to predict the stresses and deformations of
stretched-membrane structural components for loads under which part of
the membrane wrinklesrather than studying in detail the deformations
in the wrinkled region, the present theory studies average displacements
of the wrinkled materialspecific solutions of problems in flat and
curved membranes are presentedthe results of these solutions show
that membrane structures retain much of their stiffness at loads substantially
above the load at which wrinkling first occurs .on the bending of circular cylindrical shells under
the stability of circular cylindrical shells under pure bending is investigated
by means of batdorf's modified donnell's equation and the
galerkin methodthe results of this investigation have shown that,
contrary to the commonly accepted value, the maximum critical bending
stress is for all practical purposes equal to the critical compressive
stress .an improvement on donnell's approximation for thin-walled
donnell's equation for thin-walled circular cylinders is replaced by
whereisnon-dimensional form of the radial displacement andis
the distributed radial loadingthis equation retains the essential
simplicity of the original but, unlike donnell's equation, the accuracy
does not decrease as the wavelength of circumferential distortion
increases .a simplified method of elastic stability analysis for
the equation for the equilibrium of cylindrical
shells introduced by donnell in naca report no. 479 to
find the critical stresses of cylinders in torsion is
applied to find critical stresses for cylinders with
simply supported edges under other loading conditionsit is shown that by this method solutions may be obtained
very easily and the results in each case may be expressed
in terms of two nondimensional parameters, one dependent
on the critical stress and the other essentially determined
by the geometry of the cylinderthe influence of
boundary conditions related to edge displacements in the
shell median surface is discussedthe accuracy of the
solutions found is established by comparing them with
previous theoretical solutions and with test resultsthe solutions tonumber of problems concerned with
buckling of cylinders with simply supported edges on the
basis ofunified viewpoint are presented inconvenient
form for practical use .flexural vibrations of the walls of thin cylindrical
the paper deals with the general equations for the vibration of thin
cylinders andtheoretical and experimental investigation is made of
the type of vibration usually associated with bellsthe cylinders are
supported in suchmanner that the ends remain circular without
directional restraint being imposedit is found that the complexity
of the mode of vibration bears little relation to the natural
frequency,. for example, cylinders of very small thickness-diameter
ratio, with length about equal to or less than the diameter, may have
many of their higher frequencies associated with the simpler modes of
vibrationthe frequency equation which is derived by the energy
method is based on strain relations given by timoshenkoin this
approach, displacement equations are evolved which are comparable to
those of love and flugge, though differences are evident due to the
strain expressions used by each authorresults are given for
cylinders of various lengths, each with the same thickness-diameter
ratio, and also forvery thin cylinder in which the simpler modes of
vibration occur in the higher frequency rangeit is shown that there
are three possible natural frequencies forparticular nodal pattern,
two of these normally occurring beyond the aural range .the flexural vibrations of thin cylindersthe flexural vibrations of the walls of thin cylinders are consideredin this type of vibration many forms of nodal pattern may exist owing to
the combination of circumferential and axial nodestheoretical
expressions are developed for the natural frequencies of cylinders with
freely-supported and fixed ends andcomparison is made with the
frequencies obtained experimentallyin practice, the ends of cylinders are subjected tocertain degree
of fixing by end-plates, flanges, etc., and the natural frequencies thus
lie between the corresponding values for freely-supported and fixed
endsto make possible the estimation of such frequencies,method is
devised in which an equivalent wavelength factor is usedthis factor
represents the wavelength of the freely-supported cylinder that would
have the same frequency as the cylinder under consideration when
vibrating in the same modethe results of experimental investigations
with various end thicknesses and flange dimensions are recorded, and
from these the equivalent factors are derivedsets of curves calculated for cylinders with freely-supported ends and
coveringrange of cylinder thicknesses are givenfrom these it is
possible to obtain close approximation to the frequencies of cylinders
under other end conditions by the use of an appropriate factoran example
is given of frequency calculations forlarge air-receiver for
which two frequencies were identified by experiment .on the vibration of thin cylindrical shells under internal
the frequency spectra and vibration modes of thin-walled
circular cylinders subjected to internal pressure are consideredit is shown that for very thin cylinders the internal pressure
hassignificant effect on the natural vibration characteristicsfor these cylinders, particularly those having smaller length to
diameter ratios, the mode associated with the lowest frequency
is in general not the simplest modethe exact number of
circumferential nodes, n, which occur in the mode associated
with the lowest frequency, depends on the internal pressure.
if this numberis large, it decreases rapidly with increasingwhenis small, and the /fundamental/ frequency--the lowest
frequency at each p--increases rapidly with increasing internal
pressureat higher values of internal pressure the frequency
spectrum tends to be arranged in the regular manner, the frequency
increases with the increasing number of circumferential
nodes, and the lowest frequency rises slowly with the internal
pressureexperimental results on the frequency spectra, vibration
modes, and structural damping ofseries of thin-walled cylinders
subjected to internal pressure are briefly describedthese
results show agreement with the features predicted by reissner'sthe effect of slight deviation of the cylinder from perfect
circular symmetry is discussed .experimental study of the vibrations ofcircular
an apparatus is described which permits the mode
shape ofvibrating circular cylindrical shell to be
obtained quite easilythese measurements are made
without contacting the cylinder and can be converted
to actual lineal valuesa representative number of
results obtained with suchsystem are shown to illustrate
the relationship between the nodal pattern and
frequency incylinder as well as the effect of internal
pressure on these frequenciesfinally, comparisons
are made between these results and timoshenko theory
and an appropriate shell theory .the effect of an internal compressible fluid column
the free oscillations ofthin pressurized cylindrical shell containingcompressible fluid are studied herethe use of an
approximate set of shell equations (shallow shell theory) leads torelatively simple formula for the natural frequencies of the
coupled fluid-cylinder systemthe results of some computations
are presented .a theory of imperfection for the vibrations of elastic bodies of
various observations and preliminary experiments
have shown that the effect of imperfections upon the
vibrations of bodies of revolution cannot be neglectedowing to the possibility of applying the lagrange
equation, the influence of the imperfections could be
traced through the kinetic energy, the potential energy
and the dissipation functionalthough the fundamental
difficulty of the uncertainty of certain variables
was not eliminated, this procedure permitted at least
the making of general qualitative statements as to the
behaviour of the system if imperfections are present .remarks on donnell's equationsflugge's set of differential equations of equilibrium for
circular cylindrical shells is expressed inform analogous
to the donnell equationsthe results of solutions of the
two sets of equations forsimply supported cylinder undercentrally applied, uniformly distributed radial line load
overgenerator segment, as well as under sinusoidally
applied line loads, are in very good agreement for the
particular geometry investigated .energy expressions and differential equations for stress
energy expressions and the related equilibrium equations and natural
boundary conditions for the determination of the stresses in and displacements
of uniform, thin-walled cylinders of arbitrary cross section
loaded in an arbitrary manner by surface and edge forces and moments are
presentedthe derivations are based upon the kirchhoff-love
assumptions of the classical theory of shells and are performed to
withindegree of accuracy employed by flugge in his derivation of the
equilibrium equations applicable to circular cylindrical shells,. hence,
in terms of stress resultants, the exact, small-deflection equilibrium
equations are obtainedmethods of simplification of the relations
derived and of solution of the differential equations presented are
indicated .stress and displacement analysis of simply supported
this paper presents an analysis of the deflections of and stresses inshort noncircular cylindrical shell of uniform wall thickness whose
median-surface cross section is described analytically bysimple expression
corresponding tofamily of doubly symmetric ovalsthe
cylinder is underuniform lateral load and is simply supported at its
edgesthe small deflection analysis considered is based uponseries
solution of appropriate differential equations of shell theory which
leads ultimately to infinite sets of algebraic equations, truncated
forms of which are considerednumerical values of the significant
stresses and displacements for points of the oval cylinder, which arepercent of the axial length and 2.5 percent of the circumferential
length apart, have been calculated for an oval cross section withmajor-minor axis ratio of 1.10 .the accuracy of donnell's equationssolutions of donnell's equations of the small deformations
of the perfectly elastic thin-walled circular cylindrical

n. j. hoff has presented formulas which can be used in
the solution of boundary-value problems of circular
cylindersthe purpose of this note is to express these results
in exact simplified form,.more detailed investigation
appears elsewherethe notation will be that of
hoff unless otherwise stated .some experimental studies of panel flutter at mach
experimental studies of panel flutter were conducted atmach number
of 1.3 to verify the existence of this phenomenon and to study the
effects of some structural parameters on the flutter characteristicsthin rectangular metal plates were used in these studies and were mounted
assection of the tunnel wallmost of the data were obtained by
using aluminum-alloy panels, althoughfew steel, magnesium, and brass
panels were also useddifferent materials with various thicknesses
and lengths were used to determine the effect of these parameters on
panel flutterthe experimental program consisted of three phases ..
panels clamped front and rear, and (3) buckled panels clamped on all
four edgespanel flutter was obtained under controlled laboratory conditions
and it was found that, at the flow conditions of these tests, increasing
tensile forces were effective in eliminating flutter, as were shortening
the panels or increasing the bending stiffnessno apparent systematic
trends in the flutter modes or frequencies could be observed,
and it is significant that the panel flutter sometimes involved higher
modes and frequenciesthe presence ofpressure differential between
the two surfaces ofpanel was observed to havestabilizing effectinitially buckled panels were more susceptible to flutter than panels
without bucklingbuckled panels with all four edges clamped were much
less prone to flutter than buckled panels clamped front and rear .experimental studies of flutter of buckled rectangular
experimental panel flutter data have been obtained at mach numbers
from 1.2 to 3.0 for buckled rectangular panels and the effect ofpressure
differential has been determinedincreasing the pressure
differential was effective in eliminating flutter on most of the panels
testedthe effects of the variables in the panel flutter parameter

length, respectively) were investigated for buckled panels clamped on
the front and rear edges andcritical value of this parameter of 0.44
is indicated at zero pressure differential when the panel width-length
ratio is 0.69an estimated flutter boundary is presented for buckled
panels clamped on four edges, with width-length ratios of 0.21 to 4.0this boundary shows that the panel width is more significant than the
panel length when the ratio of width to length is less than approximately
0.5panels clamped on four edges and buckled in two half waves
in the direction of flow were found to be particularly susceptible to
flutterthe results of limited tests on panels with applied damping,
curvature, and lengthwise stiffeners are also presented and discussed .experimental investigation at mach numbers 3.of
skin-stiffener aluminum alloy panels consisting of four bays, each
bay havinglength-width ratio of 10, were tested atmach number
of 3.0 at dynamic pressures ranging from 1,500 psf to 5,000 psf and at
stagnation temperatures from 300to 655.  the panels were restrained
by the supporting structure in suchmanner that partial thermal
expansion of the skins could occur in both the longitudinal and lateral
directionsa boundary faired through the experimental flutter points consisted
offlat-panel portion,buckled-panel portion, andtransition
point at the intersection of the two boundariesin the region
wherepanel must be flat when flutter occurs, an increase in panel
skin temperature (or midplane compressive stress) makes the panel more
susceptible to flutterin the region wherepanel must be buckled
when flutter occurs, the flutter trend is reversedthis reversal in
trend is attributed to the panel postbuckling behavior .flutter of aerodynamically heated aluminium-alloy and
an investigation of the effects of aerodynamic heating on the flutter
of multibay external-skin panels has been carried out atmach number
of 3.0 in the langley 9- by 6-foot thermal structures tunnelboth
aluminum-alloy and 17-7 ph stainless-steel panels withlength-width
ratio of 10 for each bay were tested at dynamic pressures between
addition,few tests were made on the lower vertical stabilizer of the
x-15 airplane which has external-skin panels unsupported forlengthall panels showed flutter boundaries characterized by an increase
in panel thickness required to prevent flutter with increasing thermally
induced stress prior to bucklingafter buckling the panels showed
flutter boundaries characterized bydecrease in thickness required to
prevent flutter with further increases in thermal stressthe largest
thickness required to prevent flutter in the presence of aerodynamic
heating occurred at the transition between the flat-panel boundary and
the buckled-panel boundarythis peak value (for aluminum-alloy panel)
was as much as 60 percent greater than the extrapolated value for an
unheated, unloaded panelvalues of the modified-thickness-ratio flutter parameter for the
unstressed panels (obtained by extrapolation) were in fair agreement for
the aluminum, steel, and x-15 stabilizer panelspeak values at
transition, however, showed large differences due to apparently minor
changes in panel-support construction and or changes in panel-skin
material .test of an aerodynamically heated multi-- web wingmultiweb wing structure, representing an airplane or missile wing,
was tested under simulated supersonic flight conditions to determine the
transient temperature distributionthe aerodynamic loads played an
important and unanticipated role, however, in that the model experienceddynamic failure near the end of the testthe test is discussed and
the conclusion reached that the model failed asresult of the combined

the thermal-fatigue behaviour of nickel-base high-temperature alloys,
mainly by usinglaboratory technique with hot and cold fluidized beds
as the heating and cooling mediaa succession of heating shocks is
generally more damaging thansuccession of cooling shocks between the
same temperature limitsthe duration of the heating shock and the
upper temperature of the cycle are dominant factorsthe thermalfatigue

coupled with limiting creep rates and time-dependent fracture stresses
as (inelastic) design criteria, results in design procedures for thermal
stresses (in heat exchangers, nuclear reactors, flight structures at
supersonic speeds, etc.) of considerable unreality, the effect of
various types of rheological behavior (viscoelastic, plastic, work
hardening) on the level of thermal stresses is analyzed under simplified
assumptions, such as uniaxial stress and polar or cylindrical symmetrythe effect on the thermal stress intensity of the rheological behavior
of the material is shown to be very significant, particularly with

to one previously proposed .fundamentals of boundary layer heat transfer with streamwise
boundary-layer heat transfer is analyzed for the case ofsinusoidal
distribution of temperature in the direction of flowit is
shown that for both laminar and turbulent flow the spatial distribution
of heat transfer is generally out of phase with the wall
temperature by an angle of 30 to 45this leads to the conclusion
that in some areas the heat flow is opposite to the temperature
difference as used in the definition of the heat-transfer
coefficient, and points to the basic shortcomings of this conceptthe physical explanation for this behavior is found to be the
temperature-field distortion by the fluid motionthe distortion
is measured by the peclet numberapproximate equations

and the validity of these equations for unsteady flow is examined
with reference to limitations in frequency and wavelengtha

processes are extended to convective heat transferthis generalization
provides equations for the unified analysis of transient
heat flow in complex systems comprising solid structures and
moving fluids in either laminar or turbulent flowthe concept
ofsurface-heat-transfer coefficient is eliminated from the formulationthe theory is developed along two different linesin
one approachnew concept referred to as the /trailing function/
is introducedit represents the surface-heat-transfer properties
and may be evaluated by quite simple but remarkably accurate
variational proceduresthe method of /associated fields/ is also
generalized to convective phenomenathe second line of approach
extends to convective heat transfer the thermodynamic
concept of entropy production for both laminar and turbulent
flowthe theory amounts to an extension of the thermodynamics
of irreversible processes to systems for which onsager's
relations are not valid .the use of models for the determination of critical flutter speedsthe use of model tests in the prediction of full-scale critical flutter
speeds is now well established, and the technique of such tests is
therefore worthy of discussionin order to obtain critical speeds for
the model within the speed range of ordinary wind tunnels it is
necessary that the model should differ in some respect frommere small
suggested by mckinnon wood the modification of the model consists inreduction of its effective stiffnessesthis method has the defect /in
most cases probably not serious/ that the model experiment is conducted
atreynolds number much below that for full-scalein the present
paper it is pointed out that an alternative method of reducing the
critical speed is to increase the mass loading of the model and to make
the flutter tests in compressed air* it is then quite feasible to
reach the full-scale reynolds numberthis method of reducing the
critical speeds byproportionate increase of all effective densities
may also be combined withreduction of the elasticity of the modelthe relation of model and full-scale stresses at the critical flutter
speeds is consideredwhere the reduction in critical speed is effected
 by increase of density only, the model and full-scale stresses are
equalinmodel of reduced elasticity the stresses in the wires are
the same as for full-scale,  whereas, the stresses in the spars are less
 than for full-scalethis is in accord with the usual experience that
the wires of suchmodel are the first parts of the structure to fail
influtterlastly, the influence of gravity on flutter is consideredthis is
negligibly small for full-scale, but not necessarily so for the modelgravitational effects can sometimes be corrected by suitable orientation
 of the model .models for aeroelastic investigationthis addendum providesshort note on two aspects omitted from the

also added .on flutter testing in high speed wind tunnelsthe requirements for simulating inwind tunnel flutter conditions
appropriate to high-speed flight are discussed, and an assessment is
made of the desirable features ofwind tunnel suitable for flutter
testing at transonic and supersonic speedsit is concluded that suchtunnel should have either the mach number
or the stagnation pressure variable during the tunnel run, and that it
is of considerable advantage, and for some purposes essential, for high
stagnation pressures to be availablethe stagnation pressure required
to allow flight conditions to be simulated withflutter model is
considered to range from at leastatmospheres for transonic speeds to
about 15 atmospheres for=.  no attempt to simulate kinetic heating
is envisaged, although its effect on stiffness should be allowed for in
the design of the modelto minimise uncertainties due to the
variation of the model stiffness with temperature it is desirable that
means for controlling the stagnation temperature should be incorporated
in the tunnel .the influence of aerodynamic heating on the flexural
this report considers the loss of flexural rigidity ofthin wing due
to the presence of middle-surface stresses resulting from aerodynamic

loads was assumed to be related to the net work absorbed
byspecimenthe number of loading cycles applied

fatigue life of an aircraft .correlated fatigue data for aircraft structural jointsresults of fatigue tests carried out at r.a.e. on typical aircraft
wing structural joints are correlated to give an indication of general
fatigue behaviourthe results are plotted in the form of- logcurves, and these indicate that the mode of behaviour cannot be
attributed to any single factor, such as the type of aluminium alloy,
the ultimate tensile strength, or the mean stress of the fatigue cyclethe detailed method of design undoubtedly haspredominant influence on
behaviour, but this quality is not revealed bybroad classification
according to the proportion of load transmitted at holes .the estimation of fatigue damage on structural elementsa method is presented for the estimation of fatigue damage to

shells introduced by donnell in naca report no. 479 to find
the critical stresses of cylinders in torsion is applied to find
critical stresses for cylinders with simply supported edges under
other loading conditionsit is shown that by this method solutions
may be obtained very easily and the results in each case may
be expressed in terms of two nondimensional parameters, one
dependent on the critical stress and the other essentially determined
by the geometry of the cylinderthe influence of boundary

equation by means of trigonometric series and its application tonumber of problems concerned with the shear buckling stresses
of cylindrical shells are discussedthe question of implicit
boundary conditions also is considered .comments on 'thermal buckling of clamped cylindrical shells'in the recent paper by zuk, an expression was presented for
the critical buckling temperature ofclamped cylindrical shell
in terms of the material and geometrical properties of the shellrestraint at the edges of the shell was assumed to be provided by
rigid frames experiencing no temperature risethe circumferential stress induced in the shell when it experiencedtemperature rise, t, may be approximated by the functionin other words, there iscompressive circumferential stress along
the entire length, l, of the shellit is well known, however, that the discontinuity stresses introduced at
the junction ofshell andrigid frame (or bulk-head) are extremely
localized, and the circumferential stresses induced in the shell
decrease rapidly away from the joint .buckling offinite length cylindrical shell under

buckled panel with one surface exposed tosupersonic airstream and the
other to still air at the same static pressurethe panel is simply
supported along the leading and trailing edges by rigid edge members
separated by an elastic member represented bycompression springthe whole system is acted upon byconstant compressive force uniformly
distributed along the edge membersthe aerodynamic forces acting on
the deflected panel are found from two-dimensional /quasi-steady/

sufficiently greater thanthe elastic behaviour of the panel is given
by von karman's large deflection equations modified to cover initially

effects of initial deformations on the
buckling and postbuckling characteristics
of circular cylindrical
shells under hydrostatic pressure
is determined in an approximate mannerthe influence of initial
axisymmetric deformations is stressedalso, the classical buckling of
an axially compressed, noncircular

distributions both along the axis of the vortex and for one
cross section of the flow are presented together withpreliminary
discussion of their significance .long slender delta wings with leading edge separationthe slender-body approximation of linearized compressible flow is
applied to the problem ofdelta wing in which flow separation occurs
at the leading edgesthe vortex sheets found in the real flow are
approximated by concentrated vortices with feeding lattices, andplausible adaptation of kelvin's theorem is applied to simulate the
force-free nature of the vortex sheetthe computations show that leading-edge separation produces an
increase in lift over that given by the jones slender-wing theory and
that the lift does not vary linearly with angle of attackcomputed
pressure distributions and span loadings are presented and the theoretical
lift results are compared with the results of simple force tests
made atmach number of 1.9 .some current and proposed investigations into the flow
the practical need for research
into the aerodynamics of
slender delta wings in unsteady motion has
been emphasized inrecent
paper by zbrozektwo important aspects are ..formation
and presence ofleading-edge vorticeswith oscillatory or transientmodes of longitudinal (orchordwise) bendingthe first of the aspects
above, has already been briefly
discussed in ref..  one feature of
the flow with leading-edge vortices
which seems to be of particular
significance to the dynamic behaviour
ofwing is the shedding of vorticity
at the leading edge as well as at
the trailing edgeany time-dependent
motion, or distortion, of the wing
leads tochange in the rate at which
vorticity is shedwith more
conventional types of flow, the free
vorticity being shed only from the
trailing edge has diminishing influence
on the wing, but when the free
vorticity is shed from the leading edge,
in passing downstream, it
remains close to the upper surface of the
wingit might be expected
then, that, although the magnitudes of the
unsteady forces may not be
greatly affected forslender delta, the
time delays associated with
the forces may be significantly different
for the attached and
separated regimes of leading-edge flow .two dimensional transonic unsteady flow with shockstudy is made of the unsteady flow around an
airfoil at transonic mach numbers, the situation being
such that local supersonic regions terminated by shockwaves
are present in the vicinity of the airfoilfor
the unsteady part of the flow, small perturbations
technique is employed and the interaction with the shock
wave is taken into accountthe case of an oscillating
aileron is considered first, andsolution is derived
for the pressure distribution on the aileronit is
found that the solution hassimple form when the
shock-wave is well ahead of the hinge axis of the
aileronas the shock approaches the hinge-axiscorrection must be added to the solutionan interpretation
of these results is giventhe results are
compared with results oftheory which neglects the
presence of the shock and it is found that both agree
for=.  for1, however, neglecting the presence
of the shock waves introduces errors of the order of
magnitude (1m), whereis the local mach number
behind the shockthe theory is finally extended to include the case
in which the whole airfoil oscillates, but only the
solution for the subsonic region behind the shock is
treatedthe role of the unsteady shock-boundary layer
interaction is discussed and it is shown that this
mechanism can be included in the results of the present
theory .calibration of the standard pitot-static head used
recent results of tests in the
r.a.e. wind tunnels concerned with
the measurement of pressure distributions
have shown slight discrepancies
between the readings of various static
pressure tubes and calculated
pressure distributionsasconsequence
some doubt was felt concerning
the calibrations of tunnel static pressure
and upon the validity of the
reading given by the standard pitot-static

for the study of the pressure distribution around various body forms
was requestedthe original request for this investigation wasnatural out-growth

of generalizing the results .random vibrationrandom vibration is vibration which results
from an excitation which is not well represented by any simple
function (sinusoid, step, etc.) or any simple combination of
such functions but which is satisfactorily modeled bystochastic
processit is perhaps not too much of an exaggeration
to say that /all vibration is random vibration ./  every vibration
record contains /hash/ at some levelnevertheless,
until recently, engineering vibration theory has been able to
get along without including the consideration of random excitationsnow in several fields simultaneously there has occurredburst of activity in the application of random processesthe
response of aircraft to buffeting from atmospheric turbulence
and the response of ships to confused seas have been put on
reasonably firm footingpossibly the most dramatic problems
have been posed by the development of large jet and rocket

malfunctions of sensitive equipment .the effect of jet noise on aircraft structuresthe present state of knowledge on the
problem of fatigue failure due
to vibrations excited by jet noise is reviewedit is concluded that it should
currently be possible to make reasonable

critical flutter conditions from static considerations alonethe
idea is simply one of negation..  when the air speed exceedscertain
value statically stable equilibriumand sometimes equilibrium itself
take placethere are times when the dynamics ofsituation are
complex enough to defytractable analysisthe value of being able
to indicateflutter criterion from the simpler statics is clearwe will suppose flutter begins when some critical value of the air
speed (or some parameter simply related the to) is exceededhere
we will show that there iscritical value which, when exceeded,
precludes static equilibriumunderlying our work is the premise
that these two critical values are the samethis assumption begs
discussionwe will call the lowest value of our air speed parameter to preclude
statically stable equilibrium of the system the transtability valuein some cases, excess of this value will ban all possibility of
static equilibriumstable or not., we will then call itstrong

when certain conditions are fulfilled for thickness ratio, aspect ratio,
 and reduced frequency forthree-dimensional wing, it can be shown
that the partial differential equation for the non-steady perturbation
potential can be reduced tocomparatively simple linear equationthe solution is then obtained by applyingfourier transformation in
the free-stream direction and then using an iterative process developed
by adams and sears for steady flowthe method gives solutions valid
for low combinations of aspect ratio and reduced frequencythe method is applied todelta wing oscillating in some selected rigid
 and elastic modesfrom the results it can be seen that the special
non-steady forces in the potential equation, which are neglected in
slender-body theory, are very importantstability derivatives can also
 be obtained by the method and it is seen that the damping in pitch may
be negative at1 for delta wings of too high aspect ratio .a method of calculating the short period longitudinalmethod is developed for the
calculation of the pressure distribution
and the aerodynamic forces and
moments onwing performing harmonic
pitching and heaving oscillationsthe calculation is based on the
assumption of inviscid potential flow
without shock waves and is restricted
to small incidence, so that the
linearized theory is validin contrast to other work in the
field the theory applies to all
mach numbersit is restricted to small
values of the reduced frequency
and should be valid for the usual range
of short periods occurring at
present in flightthe formal solution
yields two integral equations for
the parts of the load, which are in phase
and go out of phase with the
oscillation,. these are of the same form
as the corresponding equation
in steady flowthe way is thus opened for solutions
over the whole mach number
range at small frequencies, if the
corresponding steady solutions can
be foundthe calculation is in fact
easiest for=and has been
done here for delta-wings to supplementprevious supersonic calculation,
made on different frequency assumptions,
which broke down near=.
it appears from the two sets of results
that the short period oscillation
will be unstable near= 1, if the apex
angle of the delta wing is
greater than about 60this confirmsnow generally recognised trendsuch results near=must of
course be invalidated to an
unknown extent by thickness viscosity and
shock waves at their maximum
effectnevertheless it is unlikely that
these factors will remove
the critical nature of the transonic damping
as calculated by this methodwith all its obvious limitations this method,
when extended to other
planforms, should provideuseful tool in
studying the effect of
geometrical parameters on the stability of
an aircraft at transonic
speeds .on the low aspect ratio oscillating rectangular wing
the laplace transform of
the lift distribution on an oscillating
rectangular wing insupersonic flow is obtained
by separating the linearised equation
for the velocity potential in elliptic (cylindrical)
co-ordinatesthe results for the case
of no spanwise distortion are expanded in ascending
powers of the aspect ratio in order
to compare with the slender body theory, and the
longitudinal stability derivatives are
calculatedit is found that at either supersonic
or transonic speeds single-degree-offreedom
instability in pitch is impossible insofar
as the fourth power of the aspect
ratio is neglected .theoretical studies of unsteady transonic flowpart iiithe oscillating

forces on an oscillating low aspect ratio rectangular wing are
calculatedthe approximate theory is valid for small values of ko /o
semi-span-to-chord ratio,.reduced frequency/ and complements an
earlier low-aspect-ratio-wing theory by the author valid only for
pointed wings like delta wingsthe present report gives formulas for
the calculation of generalized forces for any smooth, flexible or rigid
mode of oscillation with spanwise symmetrycomparisons with the slender-wing theory show that, except for wings of
very low aspect ratio, unsteady-flow effects are appreciable even at
fairly low reduced frequenciesnear the upper limit in ko for the
applicability of the present theory good agreement is obtained withrecent theory for high aspect ratios .supersonic flow over an inclined wing of zero aspect ratioan asymptotic expression is found for the lift distribution onlong,
narrow, laminar wing, at incidence insupersonic streamthe approximations
of the linearized potential theory are used .slender-body theory-review and extensionthe approximate theory of flow about slender bodies and wings originated
 by munk and jones is reviewedit is presented here inform that
emphasizes the relation to the source-sink methods of von karman and
othersthe extension to noncircular bodies is made for subsonic flow,
paralleling ward's extension for supersonic flowthe calculation of
pressures and forces and the extension of the theory to unsteady flows
are reviewed, and some discrepancies in the published literature are
explainedfinally, interpreting the jones slender-wing result as the first term of
 an expansion in powers ofbreadth parameter /e.g., aspect ratio/, it
is shown howmore accurate theory can be developed by carrying additional
terms for both subsonic and supersonic speedsthis theory of
not-so-slender wings is applied to some practical wing problems, including
direct problems of flow past given wings and problems of wing
design for minimum dragthe accuracy of the new results is assessed by
 comparison with linearized supersonic-airfoil theory for the special
case offlat delta wing .supersonic flow past slender bodies of revolution,
the theory of supersonic flow around
slender bodies of revolution, yawed or
unyawed, with pointed or open bows, based
on the linearized equation, is extended
to the case when the meridian section of
the outer surface has discontinuities in
slopeexpressions for the pressure distribution
on the surface are obtainedit is
found that the drag coefficient is no longer
independent of mach number, and tends
to zero more slowly than the square of the
thickness of the bodythe large pressure
change behinddiscontinuity is made up
remarkably rapidlythe first approximation
to the lift coefficient is unchanged .methods for estimating lift interference of wing-body
the modified slender-body method
used by nielsen, katzen, and tang
in rm a50f06, 1950, to predict the
lift and moment interference of triangular
wing-body combinations has
been adapted to combinations with
other than triangular wingsthat
part of the method for predicting the
effect of the body on the wing has
been retained, butnew method for
predicting the effect of the wing on
the body has been presentedthese
methods have been applied to the
prediction of the lift-curve slopes of
nearly 100 triangular, rectangular,
and trapezoidal wing-body configurationsthe estimated and experimental
values for the lift-curve slopes
agree for most of the cases within 10
percentsome of the higherorder
effects that must be taken into
account intheory that is to
give greater accuracy than the present
one are discusseda numerical
example illustrating the method is included .a method for calculating the lift and centre of pressuremethod is presented for
calculating the lift and pitching-moment

transonic, and supersonic speed rangesthe method covers unbanked
wings, sweptback leading edges or
sweptforward trailing edges, low
angles of attack, and the effects of
wing and tail incidencethe wingbody
interference is handled by the
method presented in naca rm's a51j04
and a52b06, and the wing-tail interference
is treated by assuming one
completely rolled-up vortex per wing

by strip theorya computing table
and set of design charts are presented
which reduce the calculations
to routine operationscomparison
is made between the estimated and
experimental characteristics forlarge number of wing-body and wing-body-tail
combinationsgenerally
speaking, the lifts were estimated to
within 10 percent and the centers
of pressure were estimated to within

hypersonic speedsseveral methods which the designer can employ in
estimating the loads on various aircraft components are discussedthe
paper deals with the characteristics of both slender and blunt
configurations and touches upon the effects of boundary-layer and
aerodynamic interference .post buckling behaviour of circular cylinderical shells
the postbuckling behavior of initially perfect, thin-walled,
circular cylindrical shells under hydrostatic pressure is investigated
with the aid of the principle of stationary potential energy
together with appropriate approximate deflection functionscalculations show that postbuckling equilibrium configurations
exist for loads greater than as well as loads slightly less than the
critical load calculated from small-deflection theoryloads
less than the critical load are obtained only forfinite range ofparameter indicative of shell geometryfor loads corresponding
to radial displacements of the order of the shell thickness, it is
found that the number of circumferential waves remain essentially
constant with increasing deflection and equal to the
number of waves developed at buckling .investigation of normal force distributions and wake
the supersonic aerodynamic characteristics of inclined bodies
of revolution at high angles of attack have been investigated in
order to providemore basic understanding of the body vortex
wake flow and its relation to the problem of body-wing interferencethe results of wind-tunnel tests, whereby the normal
force, pitching moment, normal force distributions, and the local
flow properties in the vicinity of the body were determined, are
discussed and analyzedcomparisons of experimental normal force coefficient and
center of pressure data with values calculated in accordance with
theories which include methods for estimating the effects of viscosity
show that the accuracy of these estimates is strongly dependent
on the body fineness ratio and the angle of attackfurther comparisons of the distributions of theoretical and experimentally
derived cross-flow drag coefficients clearly show that,
in general, the disagreement between experiment and existing
theories is due to the inadequate prediction of the magnitude and
distribution of the forces resulting from flow separationthe circulation strengths of the concentrated vortices and the
circulation strengths of the vortex feeding sheets in the body
vortex wake are determined by closed-contour velocity-perimeter
integrations for paths enclosing the vortex or the feeding sheetthe values of vortex strength calculated in this manner are in
close agreement with the values predicted by vortex strength
formulas written forsimple theoretical model for which it is
assumed that the cross-flow in any plane along the cylindrical
portion of the body is represented by the steady incompressible
potential flow aboutcylinder, two symmetrical vortices of
equal strength, and the attendant image vorticeshowever,
in computing these strengths it is necessary to use the vortex
locations and the viscous normal force distributions determined
from experimentthe experimentally determined values of vortex strength are,
in turn, used to calculate--by means of the aforementioned incompressible
cross-flow potential--the local flow inclination
angles which are in good agreement with the measured values,
except in the vortex core, in the vicinity of the feeding sheet,
and in regions for which transonic cross-flow velocities are expecteda consideration of these various regions with simple
methods which account for the observed phenomena leads to
substantial improvement in the agreement between theory and
experimentit is indicated that the complete vortex wake flow may be adequately
predicted forbody of revolution (for conditions represented
by the theoretical flow model), provided that the distribution
of the viscous normal force and the vortex locations are
accurately known .a new theory for the buckling of thin cylinders under
the results of experiments on axial loading of cylindrical
shells (thin enough to buckle below the elastic limit and
too short to buckle as euler columns) are not in good agreement
with previous theories, which have been based on the
assumptions of perfect initial shape and infinitesimal deflectionsexperimental failure stresses range from 0.6
to 0.15 of the theoreticalthe discrepancy is apparently
considerably greater for brass and mild-steel specimens
than for duralumin and increases with the radius-thickness
ratiothere is an equally great discrepancy between
observed and predicted shapes of buckling deflectionsin this paper an approximate large-deflection theory is
developed, which permits initial eccentricities or deviations
from cylindrical shape to be consideredtrue instability
is, of course, impossible under such conditions,.
the stress distribution is no longer uniform, and it is
assumed that final failure takes place when the maximum
stress reaches the yield pointthe effect of initial eccentricities
and of large deflections is much greater than for
the case of simple strutsmeasurements of initial eccentricities
in actual cylinders have not been made,. however,
it is shown that most of these discrepancies can be
explained if the initial deviations from cylindrical form are
assumed to be resolved intodouble harmonic series, and
if certain reasonable assumptions are made as to the magnitudes
of these components of the deviationswith
these assumptions the failing stress is found to befunction
of the yield point as well as of the modulus of elasticity
and the radius-thickness ratioon the basis of thistentative design formula (5) is proposel, which involves
relations suggested by the theory but is based on experimental
datait is shown that similar discrepancies between experiments
and previous theories on the buckling of thin cylinders
in pure bending can be reasonably explained on the
same basis, and that the maximum bending stress can
be taken as about 1.4 times the values given by equation
buckling problems can probably be explained by similar
considerations, and it is hoped that this discussion may
help to opennew field in the study of buckling problemsthe large-deflection theory developed in the paper should
be useful in exploring this field, and may be used in other
applications as wellthe paper presents the results of abouthundred new
tests of thin cylinders in axial compression and bending,
which, together with numerous tests by lundquist, form
the experimental evidence for the conclusions arrived at .stability of the cylindrical shell of variable curvaturethe report isfirst attempt to devisecalculation method
for representing the buckling behavior of cylindrical shells
of variable curvaturethe problem occurs, for instance, in
dimensioning wing noses, the stability behavior of which is
decisively influenced by the variability of curvaturethe
calculation is made possible by simplifying the stability
equations (permissible for the shell of small curvature) and
by assuming that the curvature asfunction of the arc
lengthcan be represented byvery few fourier termswe evaluated the formulas for the special case of an ellipselike
half oval with an axis ratio under compression
in longitudinal direction, shear, andcombination of
shear and compressionhowever, the results can also be
applied approximately to an unsymmetrical oval-shell segment
under compression, shear, and bending so that the numerical
values contained in the diagrams 10 to 12 represent directly
dimensioning data for the wing nose .general theory of large deflections of thin shellsgeneral theory is developed for the case of large deflections
but with rotations of the elements negligible compared to unitythe
derivation is carried out in tensor form and therefore any coordinate
system on the surface of the shell can be usedthe effect of initial
imperfections is includedit is shown that for shells of negligible
gaussian curvature (shallow shells and developable surfaces), the problem
can be reduced to the solution of two fourth-order partial differential
equations instress function and the deflection normal to the
shellfor shells formingsurface of revolution the results are
indicated in terms of the equation of the generating curvethe
differential equations for the conical shell are then listed .stability equations for conical shellsthe author rewrites v. s. vlasov's equations for (linear)
stability theory of shells (prikl. mat. meh. 8(1944), 109placementsthe result issingle eighth-order equation
for normal deflection, and two fourth-order equations
relating the displacement components in the shell middle
surface to the normal displacement .buckling of circular cones under axial compressionpresented are the results of an experimental
investigation to determine the buckling
strength of right circular cones under axial
compressioncorrelation of these data is
made with existing theory and with previously
published experimental data on circular
cylinders,. thusrecommended procedure
for predicting the buckling load of right
circular cones under the foregoing loading
condition is presented .the characteristics of roughness from insects as observed
advances in the practical development of boundary-layer
control for the maintenance of extensive laminar flow have drawn
attention to the problem of surface roughness, due not only to
artificial irregularities such as rivet heads, lap joints, window
panels, etc., but also to the kind generated in flight from impact
with insectsthis natural form of roughening, the effects of which
have been noted, though not investigated previously, is the subject
of the present paperthe phenomenon may be divided into two parts--namely,
and (2) its effect upon the stability of the laminar boundary
layerwind-tunnel experiments with the fruit fly, drosophila,
and the common housefly for the investigation of both (1) and
airfoils are fully describedthe former problem has also been
treated mathematically inseparate paper, not yet published,
agreement between theory and experiment being satisfactory in
all essentialsthe characteristics of the roughness profile consist principally
ofpronounced peak near the leading edge, followed by an extensive
area of surface over which there ismuch reduced and
gradually diminishing value of the excrescence heightfurther,
it is shown that, if the severe leading-edge roughness, or its effect
upon the boundary layer, can be eliminated, then the downstream
roughness causes no disturbance to the passage oflaminar
layer--i.e., the surface, though roughened, is aerodynamically
smoothmoreover, it appears that the conditions defining the
upstream boundary to this region of insignificant roughness are
fundamentally the same as those which determine the critical
state for transition at an artificial disturbance ofthree-dimensional
character .stability of cylindrical and conical shells of circular
we consider in this report the
determination of the upper limit of
critical loads in the case of simultaneous
action ofcompressive force,
uniformly distributed over plane cross
sections, and of isotropic external
normal pressure on cylindrical or
conical shells of circular cross sectionasstarting point we use
the differential equations for neutral
equilibrium of conical shells (ref. 1)
which have been used for the solution
of the problem of stability of conical
shells under torsion and under
axial compression (ref. 2),. upon solution
of the problem it is possible
to satisfy all boundary conditions, in
contrast to the report (ref. 3)
where no attention is paid to the fulfillment
of the boundary conditions
and to the report (ref. 4) where only part
of the boundary conditions are
satisfied by solution of the problem
according to galerkin's methodapproximate formulas are used for the
determination of the critical
external normal pressure with simultaneous
action of longitudinal compressionlet us note that the formulas
suggested in referenceare
not well founded and may lead, innumber
of cases, tosubstantial
mistake in the magnitude of the critical load .buckling of thin single- and multi-layer conical and cylindrical
the buckling of simply supported, thin, single- and multi-layer conical
shells under axially symmetrical loading is analyzed in this paperthe results are presented incompact manner so that they may be easily
used for design and/or experimental purposesthe results are compared
with known experimental values .a donnell-type theory for asymmetrical bending and
equations, somewhat more accurate than those recently
presented by n. j. hoff, are derived for bending and buckling
of thin circular conical shells under arbitrary loadingthese equations reduce to donnell's equations for thin
cylindrical shells when the cone semivertex angle becomes
very small and the minimum radius of curvature of the
median surface approachesconstant valueat the
other end of the scale the equations reduce to the wellknown
equations for flat circular plates when the cone
semivertex angle approachesright anglein addition,
for the entire range of cone semivertex angles the equations
reduce to the known equations for axisymmetrical
bending when variations of the displacements around the
circumference vanishthe problem of bending is reduced
to the solution ofsingle fourth-order partial differential
equation with variable coefficients .on the buckling of truncated conical shells in torsionthe problem of the buckling of thin circular
conical frustums in pure torsion is solved inmanner similar to that employed previously
by the author for buckling under uniform
hydrostatic pressuresynthesis of the numerical
results indicates that the critical torsion
oftruncated cone is equal to that of an
equivalent cylinder whose length and thickness
are the axial length and wall thickness of
the cone and whose radius isfunction of the
semivertex angle and the taper ratio of the
conecurves and equations to aid in the
analysis of conical frustums are givenit is shown thatprevious recommendation for
the analysis of truncated cones in torsion
may be seriously unconservative in some cases .calculations for the stability of thin conical frustums
calculations are presented for the problem of the stability of
conical shells subjected to combined external uniform hydrostatic
pressure and axial tension or compressionstress interaction
curves are found to vary only slightly asfunction of the
ratio of the end radii of the cone .some explicit solutions for constant-tempmagnetogas
in order to simplify the process of estimating the aerodynamic
loading on the after portions of slender vehicles, it is frequently
assumed that there is no nose-tail interactionit is
the purpose of this note to show that, aside from boundary-layer
effects, this assumption is not warranted when the nose hypersonic-similarity
parameter, tan, is of the order of unity, or
greaterphysically speaking, the entropy change associated
withstrong bow wave reduces the stagnation pressure downstream
of the shock, and hence, lowers the dynamic pressure in
the vicinity of the tail .ofturbulent free shear layerthe problem of predicting the mean velocity on streamlines
through the pre-asymptotic turbulent free shear layer in two-dimensional
incompressible flow is resolved into two partsthe linearized
momentum equation in terms ofgeneralized axial co-ordinate is
solved in the usual waya relation between and the distance from
the separation point is then established analytically in contrast to the
previous use of empirical expressionsit is shown that except in the region close to separation the
velocity on the streamlines can be predicted by the simple approximation
proposed by kirk .viscous compressible and incompressible flow in slender
an analytical study is made of viscous flow in slender channelssimilar solutions to the approximate equations of motion,
valid for flow at moderate or high reynolds numbers in slender
channels, are found for incompressible two-dimensional and
axisymmetric flows and for compressible flows through twodimensional
channels with adiabatic wallsa study of compressible
flows in convergent-divergent channels yields results
regarding the effect of viscosity on the location of the sonic line,
on the pressure ratio at the geometric throat and on the discharge
coefficient for such channels .secondary gas injection inconical rocket nozzledata are presented on side forces generated

the effect offorward-facing jet on
the bow shock ofblunt body inmachfree stream was investigated
experimentallythe models tested had forwardfacing
jets using air and helium exhausting
at mach numbers fromto 10.3 and
were run throughrange of the ratio of jet
total pressure to free-stream total
pressure of 0.03 (jet off) to 2.5the ratio
of body diameter to jet-exit diameter
varied from 1.12 to 55.6 and the angle
of attack was varied fromto 35the experimental results show that the
main-stream shock can be affected by
the jet in two significantly different waysone way is simply to move the strong
shock away from the body without altering its
shapethe second and perhaps more
interesting case occurs when the jet causeslarge displacement of the main shock
and considerably changes its shapeit was
found that the ratio of jet total
pressure to free-stream total pressure necessary
to obtain the large displacements
of the main-stream shock depended on the ratio
of body diameter to jet-exit diameter
and also on the jet-exit mach numberthe
maximum amount the shock could be
displaced in percent of body diameter was seen
to increase with increasing jetexit
mach number and also with decreasing ratio
of body diameter to jet-exit diameterfor the models that were investigated
through an angle-of-attack range, the
displacement became very unsteady and fell off
sharply as the angle of attack was
increasedsimplified theoretical considerations applied
to the shock-displacement
phenomena providepossible explanation for the
two different types of mainstream

of displacement would occur for different exit

nose-forward attitude only, whereas the
configuration with no afterbody was
statically stable in both the nose-forward

and moment data of both shapes were predicted
reasonably well by modified
newtonian theory at all angles of attack,
except the pitching-moment coefficient
for the model without afterbody near 180

indicated static stability, whereas

the creep-buckling times of initially straight, centrally loaded
columns as predicted by the hypotheses of shanley, gerard,
and rabotnov and shesterikov are compared with appropriate
experimental datait is found that the theoretical predictions
are generally conservative, due possibly to the fact that the
hypotheses predict initial instability times while the experiments
normally record final collapse timesof the three hypotheses,
that of gerard generally gives predictions which agree best with
the experimental data .a unified theory of creep buckling under normal loadsa general theory of creep buckling, with the initial imperfection

an approximation to the heat transfer rate acrosslaminar
incompressible boundary layer, for arbitrary distribution of
main stream velocity and of wall temperature, is obtained by
using the energy equation in von mises's form, and approximating the

surfacethe heat transfer rate toportion of surface of lengthbreadth is given as
whereis the thermal conductivity of the fluid,its prandtl number,its density,its viscosity, r(x) is the skin friction,
and t(x) the excess of wall temperature over main stream temperaturea critical appraisement of the formula indicates that it should be very
accurate for large, but that for of order 0.7 (for most gases) the
constant should be replaced by 0.73, when the error should not exceed
this yieldsformula for nusselt number in terms of the reynolds numberand the mean square root of the skin friction coefficient c, in the
case of uniform wall temperaturehowever, for the boundary layer with uniform main stream, the
original formula is accurate to withinpercent even forby
known transformations an expression is deducted for heat
transfer tosurface, with arbitrary temperature distribution
along it, and withuniform stream outside it at arbitrary
mach number (equation (42))from this the temperature distribution
along suchsurface is deduced in the case (of importance at high mach
numbers) when heat transfer to it is balanced entirely by radiation
from itthis calculation, which includes the solution ofnon-linear
integral equation, gives higher temperatures near the nose,
and lower ones farther back (figure 2), than are found fromtheory
which assumes the wall temperature uniform and averages the heat
transfer balancethis effect will be considerably mitigated
for bodies of high thermal conductivity., the author is not
inposition to say whether or not it will be appreciable for
metal projectilesbut for stony meteorites atcertain stage
of their flight through the atmosphere it indicates that
melting at the nose and re-solidification farther back may occur, for
which the shape and constitution offew of them affords evidencean appendix shows how the method for approximating and solving
von mises's equation could be used to determine the skin friction

the liquid case two solutions /notnew result/ can occur for the same
boundary conditionsan approximate analytic solution was found which
agrees closely with machine calculationsin the case of approximately exact flows, it turns out that for large
temperature variations across the channel the effects of convection /due
 to, say,wall temperature gradient/ and frictional heating must be
negligiblein suchcase the energy and momentum equations are separated,
and the solutions are readily obtainedif the temperature

measurements were made of loads induced onflat-plate wing by an air
jet exhausting perpendicularly through the wing and normal to the freestream
flowthe investigation was conducted atfree-stream mach
number of 2.0 andreynolds number per foot of 14.410an axially
symmetric sonic nozzle and two supersonic nozzles were employed for the
jetsthe supersonic nozzles consisted of an axially symmetric nozzle
with exit mach number of 3.44 andtwo-dimensional nozzle with exit
mach number of 1.76the ratio of nozzle total pressure to free-stream
static pressure was varied from 20 to 110negative loads were induced on the flat-plate wing by all the jetsas
the nozzle pressure ratio was increased the magnitude of interference
loads due to jet thrust decreasedthe chordwise center-of-pressure
location generally moved toward the nozzle center line as the pressure
ratio was increased .surface pressure distributions withsonic jet normal to adjacent flat

pressure distributions caused bysonic jet exiting normal to the
surfacetwo configurations,flat plate and an arrow-wing reentrytype
vehicle, with sonic nozzles near the leading edge were tested overrange of pressure ratios and reynolds numbers for mach numbers from
the data indicate that jet pressure ratio had considerable effect on the
 pressure levels and distributions on both configurationsalso, forconstant jet pressure ratio, the free-stream mach number effect on the
distributions and levels was quite largeover the limited range investigated,
the effect of reynolds number at constant mach number and
pressure ratio was small compared to the mach number and pressure ratio
effect .aerodynamic interaction effects ahead ofsonic jet exhausting perpendicularly

 jet slot width was varied from 0.001 to 0.05 inchthe force ratio
 due to reaction of jet/, calculated ahead of the jet, was sizable and
varied from 0.5 to. in general, the ratio increased with increasing
pressure ratio and decreasing slot widthfor the turbulent boundarylayer
separation tests it was found that the first peak pressure and the
 chordwise pressure distribution of the separated boundary layer ahead
of the jet were similar to those forseparation caused byforwardfacing

the experimentally determined interaction effects ofside jet exhausting
near the base of an ogive-cylinder model are presented and
discussedthe interaction force appears to be independent of mainstream
mach number, boundary-layer condition /laminar or turbulent/,
angle of attack, and forebody lengththe ratio of interaction force to
 jet force is found to be inversely proportional to the square root of
the product of jet stagnation-to-free-stream pressure ratio and jet-tobody
diameter ratio .approximate analysis of thrust vector control by fluid injectiona study has been made of the side force generated by injection of
secondary material into the main stream ofrocket nozzletwo cases
have been analyzed .. gas injection and liquid injectionfor the gas
injection case, it is assumed that the turbulent boundary layer ahead of
 the injection point separates from the wallthe pressure in the
separated region and the extent of the separated region are determined
byconsideration of turbulent boundary layer-shock wave interaction
and the accommodation height of the injected gas streamequations are
derived for calculating the side force, and the side forces predicted by
 the theory are compared with experimental datathe agreement between
theory and experiment is fairfor the case of liquid injection, it is
assumed that the liquid flows along the nozzle wall and evaporates into
the main streamthe resulting side force on the nozzle wall is determined
on the basis of linearized theory, thus restricting the analysis
to small rates of liquid injectionthe effects of small rates of heat
addition are also included in the analysisa very simple equation for
calculating the side force is obtained .one dimensional flows of an imperfect diatomic gaswith the assumptions that berthelot's equation of state
accounts for molecular size and intermolecular force effects, and
that changes in the vibrational heat capacities are given byplanck term, expressions are developed for analyzing onedimensional
flows ofdiatomic gasthe special cases of flow through normal and oblique shocks
in free air at sea level are investigatedit is found that up tomach number of 10 the pressure ratio acrossnormal shock
differs by less thanpercent from its ideal gas value,. whereas
at mach numbers abovethe temperature rise is considerably
below and hence the density rise is well above that predicted
assuming ideal gas behaviorit is further shown that only the
caloric imperfection in air has an appreciable effect on the
pressures developed in the shock process consideredthe effects
of gaseous imperfections on oblique shock flows are studied from
the standpoint of their influence on the lift and pressure drag
offlat plate operating at mach numbers of 10 and 20the
influence is found to be small .turbulent diffusion in the wake ofblunt nosed body
at reynolds numbers greater than aboutx 10 corresponding
to altitudes below about 180,000 ft, the hot outer inviscid
wake behind the bow shock wave produced byblunt-nosed
body at hypersonic speeds is cooled mainly by turbulent diffusion
and conductionturbulence originates in the inner wake formed
by the coalescence of the free shear layers (or annulus) shed from
the body surface when the boundary layer separates from the
surfaceas this turbulence spreads outward, it swallows enthalpy
or momentum defect originally contained in the outer
inviscid wakeif the turbulence is locally similar--i.e., if it
behaves at each station likeslice oflow-speed /self-similar/
wake--then the turbulent diffusivity grows fromlow initial
value near the body tovalue corresponding to the total drag of
the body at about 300 body diameters downstreamat flight
velocities of the order of 9,000-10,000 ft per sec. the growth of the
turbulent inner wake predicted on the basis of locally similar
turbulence is in good agreement with shadowgraph measurements
of wake widths behind spheres obtained in ballistic ranges in the
region from 200 to 4,000 body diameters downstream of the bodytentatively, one concludes that the turbulence mechanism in the
wake with respect tofixed observer is similar to the low-speed
case, in spite of the large mean temperature gradientsin order to illustrate the behavior of an observable such as
electron density inturbulent wake behindblunt body, the
two limiting cases of thermodynamic equilibrium and pure diffusion
(zero electron-ion recombination rate) are calculated for= 22 at altitudes of 100,000 and 200,000 fteven for the
case of thermodynamic equilibrium, the predicted turbulent
radar trail length is about 200 body diameters at l-band (1,300
mc) at 100,000-ft altitude and about 150 body diameters for
uhf (400 mc) at 200,000 ftone interesting result is that the
width of the plasma cylinder corresponding to the plasma requency
at l-band remains virtually constant at about 3.5 body
diameters in the range 30 150 at 100,000-ft altitudethese results are sufficiently encouraging that one can consider
including the effects of finite chemical and electron-ion recombination
rates in the analysis in order to givemore complete
picture of the wake at hypersonic speeds .concerning some solutions of the boundary layer equations
the boundary-layer equations forsteady two-dimensional motion
are solved for any given initial
velocity distribution (distribution alongnormal to the boundary wall,
downstream of which the motion is to be
calculated)this initial velocity
distribution is assumed expressible
aspolynomial in the distance from
the wallthree cases are considered ..
first, when in the initial distribution
the velocity vanishes at the wall,
but its gradient along the normal
does not,. second, when the velocity in
the initial distribution does not
vanish at the wall,. and third, when both
the velocity and its normal gradient
vanish at the wall (as atpoint
where the forward flow separates
from the boundary)the solution is
found aspower series in some
fractional power of the distance along
the wall, whose coefficients are
functions of the distance from the wall to
be found from ordinary differential
equationssome progress is made
in the numerical calculation of
these coefficients, especially in the first
casethe main object was to
find means forstep-by-step calculation
of the velocity field inboundary

even if laboriousthe same mathematical
method is used to calculate
the flow behindflat plate alongstreamthe results are shown in

sublimation and combustion occurring at the body surface .correlation of base pressure and wake structure of
it has been established in the past that there iscertain
relationship between base pressure and boundary-layer behaviorthe base-pressure and wake-flow conditions were
found to be dependent upon the local flow characteristics at the
surface of supersonic vehicles directly upstream of the base or of
the region of wake-flow separationin order to use existing data on cones and other shapes to predict
wake angle and base pressure on blunt bodies, an attempt was
made recently at the naval ordnance laboratory to establishunique relationship between given local flow conditions at the
downstream end of sharp and blunt cones at supersonic speeds
and the corresponding wake-flow conditions with zero heat transfer
.a method of computing the transient temperature of thick walls frommethod of calculating the temperature of thick walls has been
developed in which are used relatively new concepts, such as the time
series and the response tounit triangle variation of surface temperature,
together with essentially standard formulas for transient
temperature and heat flow into thick wallsthe method can be used
without knowledge of the mathematical tools of its developmentthe
method is particularly suitable for determining the wall temperature in
one-dimensional thermal problems in aeronautics where there iscontinuous
variation of the heat-transfer coefficient and adiabatic-wall
temperaturethe method also offersconvenient means for solving the
inverse problem of determining the heat-flow history when temperature
history is knowna series of diversified problems were solved by exact analysis as well
as by the new methoda comparison of the results shows the new
method to be accuratethe labor involved is very modest in consideration
of the nature of the thick-wall temperature problemlimiting solutions for the /infinitely thick/ wall and for walls so
thin that thermal lag can be neglected were also obtained .solutions to the heat-conduction equation with time dependent boundary
design charts based on the analytical solution to the problem of onedimensional
heat flow insolid body of constant material properties
with time-dependent boundary conditions were presented by kaye and
yehthis solution dealt with aerodynamic heating at hypersonic speeds
where the surface coefficient of heat transfer and the temperature
potential were taken to be linear functions of time of flightin order
 to make these charts of more general application, general solutions are
 presented which, together with the charts, enable rapid and reasonable
estimates to be made of the transient temperature distributions in many
practical cases .the temperature history inthick skin subjected to laminar heating
during high speed entry into the earth's atmosphere,vehicle can be
afforded thermal protection for the short period of entry heating bythick outer skin, sometimes called/heat sink/the temperature
distribution in suchheat sink has been found by integrating the
product of the laminar aerodynamic heating rate and the appropriate
green's function forfinite-thickness wall over the generalized
trajectory forvehicle entering the earth's atmosphere at high speeds

surface temperature that occurs during the generalized entry trajectory
for any combination of wall thickness and thermal properties is obtained
from which the performance of any material can be found, provided that
the average thermal properties may be usedas an example of the use of
 the solution, the performance of copper, graphite, molybdenum and
tungsten are compared .addendum to 'heat transfer to satellite vehicles re-entering the atmosphere

hub and the shroud of mixed-flow impellers of arbitrary designaxial
symmetry was assumed, but the forces in the meridional /hub to shroud/
plane, which are derived from tangential pressure gradients, were taken
into accountthe method was applied to an experimental mixed-flow impellerthe
analysis of the flow in the meridional plane of the impeller showed that
 the rotational forces, the blade curvature, and the hub-shroud profile
can introduce severe velocity gradients along the hub and the shroud
surfaceschoked flow at the impeller inlet as determined by the
analysis was verified by experimental results .a rapid approximate method for the design of hub shroud profiles ofrapid approximate method for the design of centrifugal compressors of
given blade shape with compressible nonviscous flow characteristics has
been developed using techniques based upon stream-filament theoryaxial symmetry is assumed, but meridional-plane forces derived from
tangential pressure gradients are includedthe method was applied to the design of an impeller in order to determine
the approximate maximum meridional streamline spacing that
could be usedthree numerical solutions for different streamline
spacings were made using the same hub profile, blade shape, and prescribed
velocity distribution along the hubthe shroud profiles obtained
from the three solutions, which utilized 3, 5, andstreamtubes,
were negligibly differentthe approximate computing time required
was 15 hours per streamtube .design and test of mixed-flow impellers, viiicomparison of experimental
three centrifugal impellers with parabolic, circular, and skewedparabolic
blading were modified byrecently developed design procedure
 to reduce the velocity gradients along the hub from inlet to outletall original dimensions except the shroud contours were retainedexperimental
investigation showed that the modified impellers had better
performance characteristics than the original impellers at all speeds
investigated, the greatest gains occurring at speeds of 1300 feet per
second and higherthese large gains probably resulted primarily from
more favorable velocity gradients and from designing these impellers
further away from the condition necessary for eddy formationthe
modified impellers were thus able to operate overwider range of
weight flows at high speedsthe modified impellers were investigated overrange of equivalent
speeds of 900 to 1500 feet per second and flow rates from maximum to the
 point of incipient surgeat 1300 feet per second, the peak pressure
ratio and maximum adiabatic temperature-rise efficiency for the parabolic-bladed
impeller were 3.07 and 0.825, respectivelyfor the same
conditions, the circular-bladed impeller and the skewed-parabolic-bladed
 impeller had pressure ratios of 3.13 and 3.15 and efficiencies of 0.737
 and 0.805, respectivelyof the three, the parabolic-bladed impeller
had the highest maximum efficiencies /0.854 to 0.800/ and the best
weight-flow range over the speed range testedon the basis of the
parameters investigated, it appears that parabolic blading is superior
to circular bladingthe experimental results indicate that the design
method of naca tn 3399 isreliable method for use in designing centrifugal
impellers .a general theory of three dimensional flow in subsonic and supersonicgeneral theory of steady three-dimensional flow ofnonviscous fluid
in subsonic and supersonic turbomachines having arbitrary hub and casing
 shapes andfinite number of blades is presentedthe solution of the
 three-dimensional direct and inverse problem is obtained by investigating
an appropriate combination of flows on relative stream surfaces
whose intersections withz-plane either upstream of or somewhere inside
the blade row formcircular arc orradial linethe equations
obtained to describe the fluid flow on these stream surfaces show
clearly the several approximations involved in ordinary two-dimensional
treatmentsthey also lead tosolution of the three-dimensional
problem inmathematically two-dimensional manner through iterationthe equation of continuity is combined with the equation of motion in
either the tangential or the radial direction through the use ofstream function defined on the surface, and the resulting equation is
chosen as the principal equation for such flowsthe character of this
equation depends on the relative magnitude of the local velocity of
sound andcertain combination of velocity components of the fluida
general method to solve this equation by both hand and high-speed
digital machine computations when the equation is elliptic or hyperbolic
 is describedthe theory is applicable to both irrotational and rotational
absolute flow at the inlet of the blade row and at both design
and off-design operations .nonviscous flow throughpump impeller onblade-to-blade surface of
the nonviscous incompressible flow throughtypical pump impeller is
analyzed onblade-to-blade surface of revolutionsolutions are obtained
forvariety of inlet conditions including several with prewhirl
 of the assumed location of the rear stagnation pointcomparison of
results from two approximate methods of analysis showed good agreement
for the zero-angle-of-attack case and reliable indication of the
existence of an eddy on the driving face atlarge positive angle of
attack .incompressible nonviscous blade-to-blade flow throughpump rotor with
the nonviscous flow throughmixed-flow pump impeller having one
splitter vane between adjacent main blades has been analyzed onblade-to-blade surface of revolution usingpreviously reported
analysis methodsolutions were obtained forvariety of flow
conditions including several cases in which whirl is imparted to the
flow upstream of the impellerthe velocity distributions on the main-blade surfaces and on the
splitter-vane surfaces in the region of the splitter vane were strongly
dependent on the assumed location of the rear stagnation pointssolutions
were obtained by assuming values of slip factor and of division of
 flow around the splitter in addition to assuming the location of the
rear stagnation pointsthese solutions indicated that the velocity
distributions in the splitter-vane region are largely determined by the
division of flow around the splitter vane and that only the region in
the immediate vicinity of the trailing edge is affected by the slip
factorblade surface velocities were obtained from two approximate methods by
specifying flow division and slip factor, and these results are compared
 with the more exact solutions of the analysis .a rapid approximate method for determining velocity distribution on impellerrapid approximate method of analysis was developed for both compressible
and incompressible, nonviscous flow through radial- or mixedflow
centrifugal compressors with arbitrary hub and shroud contours and
with arbitrary blade shapethe method of analysis is used to determine
 approximately the velocities everywhere along the blade surfaces, but
no information concerning the variation in velocity across the passage
between blades is givenin eight numerical examples for two-dimensional flow, coveringfairly
wide range of flow rate, impeller-tip speed, number of blades, and blade
 curvature, the velocity distribution along the blade surfaces was
obtained by the approximate method of analysis and compared with the
velocities obtained by relaxation methodsin all cases the agreement
between the approximate solutions and the relaxation solutions was
satisfactory except at the impeller tip where the velocities obtained by
 the approximate method did not, in general, become equal on both surfaces
of the blade as required by the joukowski condition .wing-flow study of pressure drag reduction at transonic speed by projectingstudy was made at transonic speeds by the naca wing-flow method of the
 pressure-drag reduction obtained by projectinghigh-energy jet of air
 from the nose ofprolate spheroidsupplementary information was
obtained by taking shadowgraphs of the model mounted insmall supersonic
tunnel atconstant mach number of 1.5the high-velocity jet was observed to alter the pressure distribution
over the body in suchway that the pressure drag of the body was
reduced,. thus, inrestricted sense, the nose jet producedthrust on
 the bodyunder the conditions investigated, the thrust produced by
the nose jet was never so large as that which would be expected fromconventional rearward jetfor example, under the best conditions
tested /mach number of 1.07/ the reduction in body pressure drag caused
by the nose jet more than compensated for the negative thrust of the jet
 itselfhowever, the magnitude of the net reduction in drag /change in
 body pressure drag with jet on and jet off minus the adverse thrust of
the jet/ was only about one-half of the thrust which would be produced
by the same jet exhausting rearwardthe appearance of such an unexpectedly
large effect in the first trial indicated the phenomenon to be
worth further study .the effects ofsmall jet of air exhausting from the nose ofbody
an investigation has been made atmach number of 1.62 to determine
the effects ofsmall jet of air exhausting from the nose of an
elliptical body of revolution upon boundary-layer transition and the
viscous, pressure, and total drag of the forebody at three body stations
body nose were also obtainedthe tests were conducted at reynolds
numbers of 2.1310 and 7.6610, based on body lengththe maximum
range of thrust coefficients for the small jet was fromto about
at the lower test reynolds number, for which the boundary layer was
laminar over the entire body in the jet-off condition,very small flow
 from the jet moved the point of transition forward to the vicinity of
the 20-percent-body stationas the jet flow was increased, the transition
point moved abruptly to the nose atthrust coefficient of about
gardless of the type of boundary layerat the higher test reynolds
number for which the boundary layer was largely turbulent in the jet-off
 condition the total drag, including skin friction, was reduced somewhat
 by the action of the jetalthough the forward-exhausting small jet was found to have the above
favorable effects upon the drag, these findings are not believed too
important since the question arises as to the benefits of the same small
 jet exhausting from the rear of the body in the conventional mannerno attempt was made to establish geometric optimums in the present
investigation, yet, fromgeneral consideration of the benefits indicated
by the present results and the phenomena known to occur in the
vicinity of rearward-exhausting jets, the benefits ofsmall jet exhausting
rearward would appear to exceed those of the same small jet
exhausting forward, particularly so when the flow over the body is
laminar in the jet-off condition .the extent of the jet interference flow fieldsan investigation has been made to determine jet effects on cylindrical
afterbodies housing sonic and supersonic nozzles which exhaust
againstsupersonic stream at angles of attack from 90 to 180the
tests were conducted atfree-stream mach number of 2.91 and at freestream
reynolds numbers, based on body diameter, of 0.15x106 and
stream static pressure investigated was from jet off to about 400the data presented herein showed that, in general, variation of the
ratio of jet total pressure to free-stream static pressure, jet-exit
mach number, and ratio of jet-exit diameter to body diameter had large
influences on the body pressures on the windward halves of the afterbodies
and negligible influences on the leeward pressuresthere wasnegligible effect of reynolds number on the body pressuresthe ratio
of jet total pressure to free-stream static pressure also hadlarge
influence on the base pressures at all angles of attackschlieren

the pressure distribution and pressure drag ofblunt body withsupersonic jet issuing upstream from its center were determined at
free-stream mach numbers of 1.60, 2.00, and 2.85the thrust of the jet
 issuing from the model nose was varied to study its effects on flow
around the model and to determine variation of pressure distribution and
 pressure drag of the model with the thrustat all mach numbers investigated, the pressure drag decreased with
increasing retrorocket thrust untilminimum value was reachedfurther increases in retrorocket thrust resulted in increases in the
pressure dragthe resultant drag /pressure drag plus retrorocket
thrust but excluding base and skin-friction drag/ of the model was
reduced by retrorocket operation below the drag forjet-off condition,
 except at very low retrorocket thrust coefficientsthe flow about the
 nose of the blunt body was very unstable throughout the range of mach
numbers and retrorocket thrust coefficients investigated .

withflat base and with base
cones of 50 and 70 half-anglethe 20
nose half-angle model had50
half-angle base conereynolds numbers
for the test ranged from about
maximum diametervariations in the base cone angle
resulted in significant changes in
the aerodynamic characteristics, with
lesser effects resulting from changes
in nose cone anglein particular,
the model with the 50 half-angle
conical base had only one trim angle
flat base and 70 half-angle conical
base had two trim angles (a0 and= 180)estimated variations of
the aerodynamic characteristics with
angle of attack by means ofmodified

of 90,000 and 220,000, respectivelyit
was found that the models were
statically stable about the center-ofgravity
location tested but exhibited
neutral dynamic stability for flight
at constant altitudethe
static stability was not affected by the

pitching moment from the static tests, and the damping-in-pitch moment
from the dynamic testsboth models had satisfactory stability characteristics throughout the
test mach number range but the addition of the conical afterbody hadlarge destabilizing effect .preliminary investigations of spiked bodies at hypersonic speedsgenerally accepted solutions for the problems of hypersonic flight
appear, at the moment, to be centered around the use of blunt bodies to
minimize the heat-transfer ratesthere are, however, several other
solutions to the problem, and, as part of an exploratory study of these
solutions,detailed examination has been made of the flow over blunt

these calculations are presented in the form of simple correction factors
which must be applied to the tabulated ideal-gas parametersit
has been shown that the deviations from the ideal-gas law which exist
at high pressures may causecorresponding significant error in the
hypersonic flow parameters when calculated as an ideal gasfor
example, the ratio of the free-stream static to stagnation pressure as
calculated from the thermodynamic properties of helium forstagnation

shown to affect these measurementsthe heat-transfer and temperature
measurements were made on26.6 half-angle cone and demonstrated the
effects of contamination qualitativelythe wall static and centerline

than about 0.2 percent by volume, the error in indicated mach number is
less thanpercent as calculated from the rayleigh pitot equationthe corresponding errors in wall static and center-line pitot pressures
are about 1.7 and 0.4 percent, respectively .free-flight measurements of the static and dynamic

charts which enable the determination of the aerodynamic forces and
moments acting on arbitrary bodies of revolution undergoing either separate
or combined angle-of-attack and pitching motionsbodies with
axially increasing and decreasing cross-sectional area distributions are
considered,. nose shapes may be sharp, blunt, or flat facedthe
analysis considers variations in angle of attack from -90 to 90 and

the possibility ofgradual instability
failure ofcolumn under compressive
load has been recognized
for some timemarin presented an
analysis of creep buckling based ontheory of creep bending, but did not
take into account the average stress
due to axial loadingthe theory also
neglected the transient (nonlinear)
portion of the creep curvein efficient column design, the
average stress should be relatively high in
comparison with the bending stresses,.
that is, the column should be as straight
as possible and the slenderness ratio
should not be too greatunder these
conditions marin's theory is not
directly applicable, although it gives good
agreement with tests of columns
having large slenderness ratios or large
eccentricities .principles of creep buckling weight-strength analysis
published work on creep buckling has implied that failure
of columns aftercritical time is caused by initial imperfectionssuch analyses are relatively complex and ultimately leave the
choice of selecting the proper value of the initial imperfection to
the designerfurthermore, recent test results on creep buckling
of columns have indicated that there israndom and relatively
unimportant effect of small initial imperfections on the critical
timeto avoid the difficulties associated with initial imperfections,formulation of the creep buckling phenomenon in terms of
classical stability theory is presentedthe theory permits the
extension of known solutions for plastic buckling of certain thin
plates and shells to creep buckling problems .principles of creep buckling weight-strength analysisproblem of creep stability of columns and plates

paltecomparison is made between the
results according to the flow theory and strain
theory .principles of creep buckling weight-strength analysis
the determination of column deflections and
column buckling loads has been considered for
many yearsthe available theories, however,
do not provide for materials which creep with
time under constant loadsfor the design of
structural members made of these materials,consideration of creep may be of practical
importanceplastics, concrete, and some metals
creep at normal temperatures while other
metals creep only at high temperatures and at stress
values beyond the yield pointa consideration
of creep in the design of some structures appears
appropriate in view of the modern developments
in plastics and the presence of high stress values
which are sometimes beyond the yield stressthis paper givesrational theory for predicting
creep deflections in columnsa special case
using this theory is applied to the interpretation of
some preliminary tests of an aluminum alloy .principles of creep buckling weight-strength analysis
the relation of the time-dependent tangent-modulus
load--as conceived by shanley--to actual column capacity
is clarifiedit may be interpreted aslimiting case of the
conservative estimatethe time-dependent tangentmodulus
load is, therefore, an approximation toconservative
estimatethe approximation, however, may
be either conservative or nonconservative when applied
to imperfect or real columnstypical cases are discussed
and experimental results for two alloys are cited .note on creep buckling of columnsit appears from librove's interesting analysis that, for
the case of creep buckling of columns, the initial imperfections
contained in ordinary columns provide the mechanism by
which failure due to creep occurs afterperiod of timein fact,
it can be concluded from this analysis thattheoretically perfect
column that is initially loaded below the time-independent critical
load will not buckle at allthis is an interesting contrast to the
case of static buckling where small initial imperfections play an
insignificant role, since the failing load of an initially imperfect
column is substantially the same as that oftheoretically perfect
columnit is of interest, therefore, to conjecture whether there is
any possible mechanism by whichcolumn containing no initial
imperfections can fail asresult of creep when the initial load is
less than the theoretical buckling load .note on creep buckling of columnsthe results of short-time elevated-temperature creep tests of
objective of obtaining procedures for predicting column lifetimesemiempirical lifetime curves are obtained with the aid ofpreviously
published column creep theory and are used for deriving column curvesthe semiempirical lifetime curves are also used to study the effect of
varying applied stress and out-of-straightnessin the range
considered, small variations in out-of-straightness are found to be of
little practical significance,. whereas, small stress variations change
the column lifetime considerablyfor the range of out-of-straightness
encountered in the tests, the data can be presented in plots that do not
explicitly include out-of-straightness, and plots of this type should be
satisfactory for predicting column lifetime for design purposes .note on creep buckling of columnsa method for estimating allowable
load capacities of columns subject
to creep is presentedthe method,
which utilizes approximate stress distributions
derived from isochronousstress-strain
curves to estimate
column load capacities, is shown to
be conservative for the time for which
the estimate is madean application of the method is
made to test data on as-received and
on stabilized 24s-t4 aluminum alloya comparison of the computed column
capacities with experimental capacities
indicates that the method is satisfactory
for estimating the decrease in
capacity with increasing timeeasily obtained, time-dependent tangentmodulus
loads are discussedthey are interpreted as being approximations
to allowable load-capacity
estimatesa limited application is made to
test data, and the results
appear promisingit is concluded that if
certain limitations are recognized,
the method may prove to be useful because
of its simplicitya presentation of the results of an
experimental investigation of the
effects of column imperfection and columnmaterial
variation is madeit
is found that column-capacity variations of
the order of 10 per cent can
result from column-imperfection differences
and column-material variationthe results of an experimental study of
the variation of column capacity
with temperature of exposure are presentedthey indicate that column
efficiency, as measured by decrease in capacity,
can be acceptable for very
short times at the higher temperaturesthe
efficiency at these higher temperatures
falls rapidly, however, with increasing time .note on creep buckling of columnsthe results of short-time creepbuckling
and creep-bending tests of
slenderness ratio 111 are presentedthe tests were performed at 600 f,
and strain measurements were taken
with high-temperature electric-resistance
strain gagesa description
of the development of the gages is given
in an appendixthe column
tests show that the critical time decreases
much more rapidly with
increasing load than with increasing initial
deviation from straightnessthe bending tests indicate that the steady
creep rate of the curvature
issimple power function of applied
momentthese latter results,
together withpreviously derived creepbuckling
theory, are used to
developsemiempirical formula suitable
asguide for the determination
of the critical time for columns .note on creep buckling of columnsthis paper describes theory and tests of the creep collapse
of long thin aluminum-alloy cylinders under external radial
pressuresteady-state creep is assumed in the theoretical derivationthe test temperatures were between 300 and 500.
the collapse time for each cylinder was calculated theoreticallyagreement between theoretical and test results was fair .note on creep buckling of columnsforty-three cylinders of 40-inch
length and 16-inch diameter, made
of 5052-0 aluminum-alloy sheets of
thickness, were subjected to bending
moments constant along the cylinder
and in time in an oven which maintainedconstant temperature of 500during the testall the cylinders
failed by bucklingthe time that
elapsed between load application and
collapse was measured .note on creep buckling of columnsa theory of creep buckling is presented in which the instantaneous
elastic and plastic deformations following the application ofload, as
well as the steady creep deformations, are considered in an approximate
mannerequations are given from which the critical time, that is, the
time elapsing between load application and the collapse of the column,
can be computed .note on creep buckling of columnsthe general dynamic equation of
creep bending ofbeam loaded laterally
and axially was derived forlinearly viscoelastic material whose
mechanical properties can be characterized
by four parametersthe material
can exhibit instantaneous and retarded
elasticity as well as pure
flowthe equation derived was used to
obtain the creep bending deflection
ofbeam in pure bending and ofcolumn
with initial sinusoidal deviation
from straightnessas expected, the
ratio of the creep deflections
of the beam in pure bending and the
deflections ofcorresponding purely
elastic structure is identical to the
ratio of the creep strain and the
corresponding elastic strain ofbar
under simple tension or compressionthe results of the analysis of the
creep deflection of the column
showed that the deflections increase
continuously with time and become
infinitely large only when the loading
time is correspondingly largehowever, large deflections are obtained
in reasonably short periods of
time if the applied load is near to the
euler load of the columnthe
deflection-time curves obtained fromnumerical example are of the same
type as those determined by experiment
with aluminum columns .note on creep buckling of columnsthe creep ofslightly crooked section column carryingconstant load is studied theoreticallythe material of the column
is characterized bystrain-time relationship, under constant
uniaxial stress, of the form, where is
the total strain, is the constant stress, is the time, and e,a,b,
andare material constantsthis form was selected because it
applies to at least two alloys--75s-t6 aluminum alloy at 600.
andlow-alloy steel at 800 and 1,100.  however, the analysis
is intended for any material having creep properties of the
same form and for which the material constants are knowna
strain-time relationship under variable uniaxial stress, necessary
for the column analysis, is formulated from the constant-stress
properties with the aid of shanley's engineering hypotheses of
creepthe analysis leads to the conclusion that the lateral deflection
approaches infinity--that is, the column collapses--in finite timeresults are given showing the maximum length of time the column
can supportgiven load before it collapses and the growth
of stresses, strains, and deflections prior to collapse .note on creep buckling of columnsthis paper is concerned with the solution of the creep buckling of
columnsinstantaneous elastic and plastic deformations, as well as
the transient and secondary creep, are consideredformulae for the
critical time at whichcolumn fails are presented for integral values
of the exponents appearing in the creep law .note on creep buckling of columnsa phenomenological relation between
stress, strain rate, and temperature
is suggested to account for the
behavior of polycrystalline metals
above the equicohesive temperaturethe properties of the metal
included in the relation are elasticity,
linear thermal expansion, and
viscositythe relation may be integrated
under various conditions to
provide information on creep rates, creep
rupture, stress-strain curves,
and rapid-heating curvesit is shown
that for one material7075-t6
aluminum-alloy sheetthe information
yielded by the relation for these
four applications agrees reasonably
well with test data .note on creep buckling of columnsthe phenomenological theory previously
proposed in naca technical
note 4000 for the behavior of metals at
elevated temperatures has been
modified to yield transient creep curves
by assuming that the metal consists
of two phases, each with its own
elasticity and viscositythe
extended theory satisfies the basic
requirements fortheory of transient
creep at elevated temperatures ..
that the transient creep be closely
connected with the subsequent steady
creep, and that the apparent exponent
of the time in the transient region
be permitted wide variations
betweenand.  from this theory it is
possible to construct nondimensional
creep curves which extend continuously
from the transient region
into the steady-state regionthe
corresponding family of creep curves
for any metal may be obtained from
the nondimensional family by use of
appropriate constantsthe constants
required are those obtained from
steady creep measurements, together
with two additional constants which
represent the difference between the
phasesthe transient creep curves
resulting from this theory are compared
with the experimental curves
for pure aluminum, gamma iron, lead, and
agreement is found .note on creep buckling of columnsa variational theorem is presented forbody undergoing
creepsolutions to problems of the creep behavior of plates,
columns, beams, and shells can be obtained by means of the
direct methods of the calculus of variations in conjunction with
the stated theoremthe application of the theorem is illustrated
for plates and columns by the solution of two sample
problems .note on creep buckling of columnssome general topics in elastic stability are discussedin
particular, attention is given to the relationship between adjacentequilibrium-position
and energy techniques, to the effects of nonlinearity,
and to the sensitivity of certain stability problems to the
character of the loading .note on creep buckling of columnsa general variational theory of elastic stability that was
originated by e. trefftz (1) is applied to the problem of
buckling of rings of rectangular cross section subjected to
uniform external pressurethe theory is believed to be
more rigorous than previous treatments of the problem,
since it avoids conventional assumptions of curved-beam
theory, such as the assumptions that plane sections remain
plane and that radial stresses vanishthe classical
result of levy (2) is confirmed forring of infinitesimal
thicknessnew results are obtained which show the
effect of the finite thickness ofring on the coefficients in
the buckling formula .on the conservativeness of various distributed force systemsthe necessity of determining the conservativeness of force systems in
instability problems is discussed in reference.  it is shown that,
whereas kinetic methods are generally applicable for the determination
of instability loads, the statical methods usually employed are valid
only for conservative and nongyroscopic systemssmall changes in
the character of the loading could make an otherwise conservative
system nonconservative and causelarge change in the magnitude of the
buckling loadthe buckling load of the cantilever column example
in referenceis, for tangential end loading, eight times that for
conservative, constant directional loading .the design of tubes under uniform external pressure on the
since the failure of tubes under uniform external pressure depends
very much upon the various kinds of imperfections in them,
it seems logical to derivedesign formula for such tubes in
which the quantities depending on imperfections will appear explicitlythe most common imperfection in tubes is an initial ellipticity,
the limiting value of which in each type of tube is usually well-known
from numerous inspection measurementsthe deviation of the shape
of the tube fromperfect circular form can be defined by the
initial radial deflections w' .note on creep buckling of columnsa long, thin-walled cylindrical shell is loaded byuniform external
pressureequations are developed for the time behavior
of the shape of the cross section under the following conditions ..
formations expressible bypower creep law,. (b) the initial and
subsequent mode shape of the deviations from circularity of any
cross section is two-lobed,. and (c) the shell construction is of the
sandwich type, with concentric cylindrical membranes taking
normal stresses and an annular core supporting shear without
deformationexplicit solutions are obtained for the particular
case of the cubic creep lawit is shown that the nondimensional
amplitude of the cross-sectional mode shape (briefly, shape factor)
will become infinite infinite timecurves of shape factor
versus time and of collapse time versus initial value of the shape
factor are presentedalso given are an explicit expression for
andcurve of the expected variation in collapse time owing to
uncontrollable deviations fromnominal initial value of the
shape factorit is shown that the expected variation is small
if the nominal initial shape factor value is sufficiently large .note on creep buckling of columnsthe stability ofcompressed elastic
ring has been studied bymethod which
can be extended to solve the problem
of the stability offlexible heavy structure
spread bysystem of hoops as incrinoline
skirtthe original work by levy, which
was developed by timoshenko and love,
cannot be generalized to problems in
which the compressing forces are affected by
the deformation of the ringit is shown that the load at whichring
will buckle depends not only upon the
magnitude of the load but also upon its first
derivative relative to the radial distancea positive derivative causes the ring to
buckle athigher loadwhen this result
is applied tocone of heavy and loosely
draped fabric spread byrigid hoop of
radius andlarger and flexible hoop
of radius below it, both hoops being in
horizontal planes, then various modes
of buckling other than oval are possible
according to the relative magnitudes of
andit is found that oval buckling
changes to three-wave buckling when
three-wave changes to fourwave
when, and as and
approach nearer to equality the buckled
form progressively changes to more waveswhen applied tostructure spread by
many horizontal hoops of which the top
one is rigid and oval, it is found that all
other hoops, if each is designed to the
criterion, will have the same
absolute deviation from circularity as the
rigid hoopif any one hoop is designed
so that, then the oval shape of
the rigid hoop is magnified on all flexible
hoops .on transverse vibrations of thin, shallow elastic shellsaccording to marguerre (proc. 5th internat. congress
appl. mech., cambridge, mass., 1938, wiley, new york,
shells are governed by three simultaneous differential equations
in the three displacementsthe author has considerably
simplified this theory for the case of transverse vibrations
by ignoring the longitudinal inertia terms, thus reducing
the problem to that of solving two simultaneous
differential equations instress function and one displacement
componentthis simplification is justified by an orderof-magnitude
analysis, and illustrated by considering the
vibrations ofparaboloidal shell withrectangular
boundary .on transverse vibrations of thin, shallow elastic shellsit is shown thatperfectly straight bar, subjected
tostate of uniform shear stress, will
buckle, inmanner similar tocolumn under
compression, if the shear stress exceedscertain critical valuethe buckling equations
are obtained by the newtonian approach
and also by the application of the principle
of minimum potential energyin
order to provide additional insight into this buckling
mechanism,simple model is
introduced and analyzed .on transverse vibrations of thin, shallow elastic shellsthe deformation and complete stress

cylinder andportion ofsphere,on transverse vibrations of thin, shallow elastic shellsan experimental investigation was
made (1) to evaluate previously
published theoretical procedures for
the prediction of stress distribution
for cases of radially symmetric
abrupt change in wall thickness of
thin-walled cylinders subject to
internal pressure and (2) to investigate
the significance of stresses
attributable to the presence of thickness
changes typical of design practiceone theory was adequate in itself
for solution of the case of continuous
middle surface,. use of the
second theoretical procedure was required
to determine the additional
stresses arising from discontinuous middle
surfaces at the change in
thicknesscomparisons were made between
theoretical and experimental stress
distributions for cases with continuous
middle and continuous inner surfaces
for radially symmetric changes in
wall thickness ofcylinder
subject to internal pressure for diameter
to larger wall thickness ratios
of 117 and 28 and for the case ofcontinuous outer surface forratio
of 28in all tests the ratio of wall
thicknesses at the change in wall
thickness was 0.4there was reasonably good correlation
between theoretical and experimental
curves of stress distributionon the basis of this correlation,
it was concluded that the applicable
theories were validit
was shown that inclusion of the stresses
arising from the condition of
discontinuous middle surfaces atchange
in thickness has an important
effect on stress distributionin the case ofcylinder withcontinuous outer surface, the maximum
mean effective stress was of sufficient
magnitude to indicate that
this geometry should be avoided in design
if possiblethe maximum
mean effective stress was not increased tosignificant degree by the
presence ofchange in wall thickness in
the other cases .on transverse vibrations of thin, shallow elastic shellsexperimental measurements of pressures and heat-transfer
rates over three blunt afterbodies of small fineness ratio in fully
separated wakes are presentedthe afterbodies are generally
similar in shape but have different stepdown heights from the end
of the forebodytests were made by means ofnew shroud technique overrange of reynolds numbers closely corresponding to typical
flight conditions at mach numbers on the order of 20, considering
models on the order offt. in diameter at about 120,000 ft. altitudestagnation temperatures on the order of 1,300 r. tostrictly speaking, the test flows correspond to prototype flows
which would be created byforebody consisting ofsharp or
slightly blunted 54 half angle cone which turns cylindrical forshort distance and then connects with the afterbodyjudiciously
interpreted, the results may be considered to havesomewhat
wider applicability for approximation purposesthe results are
presented and compared with each other in terms of nondimensional
variables based on flow conditions at the end of the forebodythe pressure distribution along an afterbody is seen to be
roughly uniform in each runforgiven point on an afterbody,
the ratio of pressure to the stagnation pressure at the forebody
end (or exit) decreases with increasing stagnation pressure or
reynolds numberthe present pressures and pressure-reynolds
number variations (fig. 8) are compared with values obtained
from chapman's machorbase-pressure data,. qualitative and
some quantitative agreement is notedin the reynolds number
range comparable to those of the present tests, chapman's exit
boundary layers were considered to be laminaran approximate
check of the heat-transfer rate at the forebody end in the present
tests also indicateslaminar rateno information was obtained
concerning the possible transition of the free-mixing separated
boundary layer covering the wakean adverse pressure gradient
on the cylindrical end of the forebody figs. 7(a) and 7(c) was
observedheat-transfer rates are seen to be roughly uniform over an
afterbody in each run, although some increase in the streamwise
direction is notedthe afterbody nusselt number (n) varies
with the reynolds number (r evaluated at the forebody end)
roughly in the mannerr where generally (fig. 13)heat rates on the rear faces of the afterbodies are almost
twice the values on the sidesthe heat rates on the large-step
body are higher than those on the body of zero stepdown heightin an addendum, it is shown that the prandtl-meyer expansion
angle of the flow leaving the afterbody increases with increasing
test reynolds number, and that the corresponding local mach
number square increases linearly with reynolds numberthe
effect is to keep the local wake reynolds numbers virtually constant
with increasing test reynolds number while the afterbody
heat rates increase sharplythe expansion angle on the afterbody
of zero stepdown height is significantly smaller than on the
stepped down bodies,. this may affect the decreased heat rates on
this body .analysis of stresses in the elements of shell structurethe love-meissner analysis for thin shells has previously been applied
to cones of uniform wall thickness, and solutions for the stress
resultants were given in terms of kelvin's functionssince tabulation
of these functions for large arguments is not practical, considerable
computation was still requiredin the present paper, the authors
define special functions which eliminate the necessity of evaluating
kelvin/s functions and which may be used with simple algebraic and
trigonometric functions to compute the boundary forces and displacements
for cones for various loading conditionsthese special functions also
make clear the magnitude of errors which result from geckeler/s and
other approximate solutions .on transverse vibrations of thin, shallow elastic shellsthe report presents information
on the stress problems in the
analysis of pressurized cabins of
high-altitude aircraft not met with
in other fields of stress analysis
relating to aircraftthe material
may be roughly divided into shell
problems and plate problems, the
former being concerned with the
curved walls of the cabin or pressure
vessel and the latter being concerned
with small rectangular panels of
its walls, framed by stiffeners, but
not necessarily plane .on transverse vibrations of thin, shallow elastic shellsa numerical analysis is given for the solution of the
general equations of thin shells of revolution subjected to
rotationally symmetric pressure and temperature distributionsthe basic differential equations are invery general
form, which permits the geometry of the shells considered,
to be specified by discrete data pointsthe analysis determines elastic stresses, strains and
displacements for multi-layer and multi-sectional shells of
revolutionsurface loads, temperatures, thicknesses and
material properties may vary arbitrarily in the meridional
directiontemperatures and material properties can also
vary through the thicknessthe solution is obtained by direct computation usingnumerical method that employs two by two coefficient matrices,.
and hence avoids the problems of slow convergencethe solution has been programmed insemi-algebraic
language which can be used on most high speed computerscomparisons of numerical solutions to known exact and approximate
solutions of the thin shell equations are made to
demonstrate the accuracy of this method .on the theory of thin elastic shellsgeneral equations for the symmetrical finite deflection ofrotationally symmetric thin shell are first obtainedfor
small deflections these equations are reduced topair of
equations for the change of slope of the shell surface and
the product of the undeformed radius of the shell to the
radial stressthis choice of dependent variable is shown to
be advantageoustwo cases of shallow shells give particularly
simple solutions ..  parabolic shells of nth degree and
uniform thickness, and parabolic shells of mth degree with
thickness varying as mth power of the distance from the
apexfor the first case, the solutions can be expressed in
terms of cylinder functions,. for the second, in powers of
the paper concludes withdiscussion of the asymptotic
solutions for small thickness .the bending strength of pressurized cylindersdiscussion of previously presented experimental data for the
loading of pressurized cylinders, in terms of membrane theory .the bending strength of pressurized cylindersa theoretical solution is given
for the critical stress of
thin-walled cylinders loaded in torsionthe results are presented
in terms offew simple formulas and
curves which are applicable
towide range of cylinder dimensions
from very short cylinders of
large radius to long cylinders of small
radiustheoretical
results are found to be in somewhat better
agreement with experimental
results than previous theoretical
work for the same range
of cylinder dimensions .the bending strength of pressurized cylindersbe described here is attributed to the russian
investigator v. g. galerkin, whose original papers are
inaccessible to the present writerhis knowledge
of the method is derived fromdescription given inpaper by e. p. grossmangrossman states
that the method was given by galerkin in his treatise
p. 897), and that applications to oscillation problems
were first made by v. p. lyskovit is pointed
out by grossman that galerkin's process in applications
to mechanics leads to the same results as
lagrange's principle of virtual work, but employsspecial co-ordinate systemthe method of galerkin belongs to the same general
class as those of rayleigh and ritz, for it seeks
to obtain an approximate solution ofdifferential
equation with given boundary conditions by takingfunction which satisfies these conditions exactly,
and proceeds to specialise the function in suchmanner as to secure approximate satisfaction of the
differential equationthe selected function islinear combination ofindependent functions, and
the coefficients are determined byprocess of
integrationthe galerkin process can be considered from two
points of view, (a) simply asmeans for the
approximate solution of differential equations, and
treatment of problems concerning the statics and
dynamics of elastic and other deformable bodiesthese two aspects are treated separately in partsandof the paper respectively, and will now
be briefly discussedwhich satisfies the boundary conditions, in
the differential equation besince the result should be
zero, is the error in the differential equationthen the galerkin process consists in choosing thecoefficients in the function in suchmanner thatdistinct weighted means of the error, taken throughoutcertain range of representation, shall all
be zeroasgeneralised force, and the multipliers used
to weight the errors are the virtual displacements
corresponding to increments of each of the generalised
co-ordinates in turnthus the vanishing of the
weighted mean is here interpreted as the vanishing
of the virtual work in the appropriate displacementthe degree of accuracy attaindd can be increased
indefinitely by increasing the number of independent
functions employed, but this entailsgreat
increase of labourhowever, when the functions
are well chosen, an excellent approximation can be
obtained by the use ofvery small number, as is
sufficiently shown by the examples included in this paper .a small deflection theory for curved sandwich platesa small-deflection theory that takes into account deformations

procedure which permitscompressive buckling analysis of
cylindrical shells withknowledge of the cylinder geometry onlythis analysis is achieved by correlating experimental data statistically
with theoretical parametersin order to provide data not previously available, an extensive
series of axial compression tests of pressurized cylinders has been
performedthese data, together with all other known test data,
are analyzed semiempiricallyin the analysis best-fit curves

probability curves from the test datain general, these statistically
defined design curves are significantly lower than previously
available design curves .recent advances in the buckling of thin shellsthe importance of the field of shell analysis is evidenced by the
fact that in august, 1959, the international union of theoretical
and applied mechanics conductedsymposium on the theory of thin
elastic shells in delft, hollandthis special meeting was attened by
approximately 65 scientists in this field from 14 countriesthis
symposium indicated that considerable interest currently exists in
such relatively new topics as the buckling of bimetallic shells,
pressurized shells, creep buckling, and dynamic buckling, as well as
in the more traditional problems involving isotropic shells of various
geometries .spherical cap snappinga nonlinear boundary value problem for the determination of

in the buckled states both as the loading increases and as
the thickness of the shell decreases .iterative solutions for the non-linear bending of circular

edge restraintboth temperature and mechanical
loads are accommodated as an extension of investigations
performed for the isothermal mechanical
loading probleman exact mathematical formulation
within the framework of the v. karman large
strain-displacement relations is developedthe equilibrium
equations and boundary conditions are then
derived by utilizing the calculus of variations for arbitrary
axisymmetrical temperatures and normal distributed
loadingthe satisfaction of equilibrium and
compatibility equations requires the solution of two
simultaneous nonlinear ordinary differential equations
subject to the prescribed boundary conditionsanalytical
solutions of such equations are apparently not
possible and therefore numerical procedures must be
employeda finite difference procedure utilizing /relaxed

annular-disk springs of uniform cross section may be
proportioned to givewide variety of load-deflection
curves not readily obtainable with the more conventional
forms of springs, and that, although the versatility of this
type spring has long been indicated, the formulas available
have not been presented inmanner to disclose
readily the effect of spring proportions on characteristicstherefore the authors have derived the formulas presented
in this paper with the intention that the formulas will aid
the designer in arriving at suitable characteristics by
choice of spring geometrythese new formulas have
been in use for several years at the general motors corporation
research laboratories section, and their reliability
has been checked by tests of springs used invariety of special test equipment .the conical disk springthis paper presents approximate formulas

and extension of the previous work
of almen and laszlo .the nonlinear conical springthe large symmetric deformations of shallow conical shells are
of interest in the design of nonlinear conical disk springsin most
applicationsuniformly distributed axial load acts at the inner
and outer edges,. these edges are otherwise freeseveral approximations
have been proposed to describe the behavior of
these springsa first approximation (1) is based on the assumption
that meridional strains are negligiblethis requires that the
shell remain conical after deformation and also that the extensional
strain of meridional lines on the middle surface vanishanother approximation (2) retains only the assumption that the
shell remains conicalthe first assumption satisfies neither of
the two boundary conditions at the free edges,. the latter
violates the condition of vanishing moment at the free edgesrecently
the authors presentedseries solution (3) forspecial
case, namely, the case of an annular plate under similar loadingnumerical solutions for the shallow conical shell under these
conditions of load have also been obtained (4)an examination
of these results indicates that the meridional bending stresses are
of much smaller magnitude than the circumferential bending
stresseshence the present analysis is based on the neglect of the
meridional bending moment .buckled states of circular platesauthors discuss the thin elastic circular disk of constant thickness

stagnation pointthe ablatedlength
measurements were in close agreement with
analytical predictionsthe
analytical predictions, upon inclusion of the
pertinent material property values,
should be applicable to other materials as well
as teflon .wind tunnel measurements of aerodynamic damping derivatives

base diameter of the blunted cone
was greater than the diameter of the
afterbody which necessitatedreflex angle downstream from the cone
base)two basically different methods,
the /electrical power-input/ and
the /decaying oscillations/ methods were
used to determine the damping
and frequenciesthe experimentally
determined values are compared with
some applicable theoriesthe results
of the investigation indicate
that the aerodynamic damping in the

for long flat plates and wide columns under axial compression
and moderate-length cylinders under external pressure, torsion,
and axial compression .instability analysis of cylindrical shells under hydrostatic
to determine the elastic buckling
pressure of simply supported
cylindrical shells subjected to lateral
and axial hydrostatic forces,
various versions of linear bending
theories have been employed in the
pastfor certain shell dimensions,
however, the expressions commonly
used may yield substantially differing
resultsin what follows,
recent work on this problem by
a. e. armenakas and the writer is
briefly reviewedthis work consisted
primarily in employinggeneral
bending theory of circular cylindrical
shells under the influence of
initial stress, developed earlier by
the same authors, to re-examine
the problem mentioned, and compare the
results with those of previous
investigationsthe outcome was the
establishment ofsimple but
accurate expression for the buckling
pressure applicable towide
range of shell dimensions .design and testing of honeycomb sandwich cylinders
experimental results for 36 diameter honeycomb cylinders fabricated
with thin (0.010) aluminum faces and cores prove that it is
quite feasible to stabilize thin faces so they can be loaded beyond
the yield pointthe effect of initial imperfections and the various
modes of failure are discussed .buckling of orthotropic and stiffened conical shellsdonnell type stability equations for thin circular orthotropic
conical shells are presented and solved for external pressure, axial
compression and combined loadingthe solution is likewise applied
to stiffened conical shellscorrelation with equivalent cylindrical
shells yieldssimple approximate stability analysis for orthotropic
or ring-stiffened conical shells under hydrostatic pressurethe
general instability of stiffened conical shells under hydrostatic
pressure is also analysed bymore accurate approachpreliminary
experimental results for buckling of ring-stiffened conical shells
under hydrostatic pressure are presented and discussed .stability of thin torispherical shells under uniform
the stability of the toroidal portion oftorispherical shell
under internal pressure is considered from the point of view of the
linear buckling theorya detailed stress analysis of the prebuckled
shell is made employing asymptotic integrationthe change in potential
energy of the shell is then minimized usingrayleigh-ritz
procedure for actual computation of the critical pressurenumerical
results reveal that elastic buckling may occur for very thin shells
whose material hasrelatively high value of the ratio of yield stress
to elastic modulus .ignition and combustion inlaminar mixing zonethe analytic investigation of laminar combustion
processes which are essentially two- or three-dimensional
present some mathematical difficultiesthere are, however,
several examples of two-dimensional flame propagation
which involve transverse velocities that are small in
comparison with that in the principal direction of flowsuch examples occur in the problem of flame quenching
bycool surface, flame stabilization onheated flat plate,
combustion in laminar mixing zones, etcin these cases
the problem may be simplified by employing what is
known in fluid mechanics as the boundary-layer approximation,
since it was applied first by prandtl in his treatment
of the viscous flow overflat platephysically it
consists in recognizing that if the transverse velocity is
small, the variations of flow properties along the direction
of main flow are small in comparison with those indirection normal to the main flowthe analytic description
of the problem simplifies accordinglythe present
analysis considers the ignition and combustion in the
laminar mixing zone between two parallel moving gas
streamsone stream consists ofcool combustible mixture,
the second is hot combustion productsthe two
streams come into contact atgiven point andlaminar
mixing process follows in which the velocity distribution is
modified by viscosity, and the temperature and composition
distributions by conduction, diffusion, and chemical
reactionthe decomposition of the combustible stream
is assumed to follow first-order reaction kinetics with
temperature dependence according to the arrhenius lawforgiven initial velocity, composition, and temperature
distribution, the questions to be answered are ..  (1) does
the combustible material ignite,. and (2) how far downstream
of the initial contact point does the flame appear
and what is the detailed process of developmentsince
the hot stream is of infinite extent, it is found that ignition
always takes place at some point of the streamhowever,
when the temperature of the hot stream drops belowcertain value, the distance required for ignition increases
so enormously that it essentially does not occur inphysical apparatus of finite dimensionthe complete
development of the laminar flame front is computed using
an approximation similar to the integral technique introduced
by von karman into boundary layer theory .a practical method for numerical evaluation of solutions

subscripts indicate partial differentiations and q, k,aretheoretical and experimental investigation of second-order supersonic
approximate second-order solutions for the supersonic flow around wingbody
combinations are calculated, using two different theoretical models
small and the wing sweep small in comparison with that of the mach cone
are consideredthe analysis is restricted to such high mach numbers
that m-2 1, and an approximate formula common to the two models is then
found for the second-order interference termthis formula can also be
used to correct experimental pressure distributions for the effect of
nonuniformities in the wind-tunnel flowin order to test the theory, wind-tunnel experiments on non-lifting
cone-cylinder bodies in combination with wings of simple shapes were
performedpressure distributions were measured at3 and4, both
around the bodies and on the wings separately, as well as in combination,
and it was found that the second-order interference was predicted
reasonably well by the simplified theory .an experimental and theoretical investigation of second-order supersonic
pressure distributions on the wing of two wing-body combinations are
measured experimentally at mach numbersandwith the wing at various
 incidences in the range 0degree to 10degreethe results are compared
with theoretical results which include interference effects calculated
according to the second-order supersonic wing-body interference theory
due to landahl and beane /1/this theory, having been tested previously
for non-lifting wing-body combinations, is thus tested also for
wings at incidencethe agreement between theory and experiment is
found to vary with mach number and wing sweepbackfor the higher mach
number and moderate sweepback the theory givesgood prediction of
pressure distribution, but for the most adverse condition of low mach
number and large sweepback the theory is found to overestimate the
interference effectsthis is expected as the theory assumes the
sweepback of the wings is small compared with that of the mach linean
 empirical guide to the limit of application of the interference theory
is givenwithin this limit the agreement between theory and experiment
 is found to deteriorate onlylittle with increase of incidence, over
the range tested .an approximate method for determining the displacement effects andsimplified approximate theory is presented by means of which the
laminar boundary layer over an insulated two-dimensional surface may be
calculated,linear velocity profile being assumed, and an estimate
made of its effect in changing the pressure distribution over the profile
upon which the boundary layer is formedskin friction is also
determinedcomparisons of results from this theory are made with experimental

carried to the same accuracy as the solution at reynolds number 40portion of the cylinder continues to increase with reynolds number in
such steady-state solutions up toreynolds number 44 and no indication
 has been found that this process will not continue as the reynolds
number is increased beyond 44 .finite difference formulae for the square latticesthe paper gives approximate formulae
for derivatives (including combinations
like and ), and integrals, offunction
of two independent variables, in terms

the range consideredthe effect of the orifice size is to decreaseas the orifice size increases, this decrease is very small but increases
 with the reynolds numberatreynolds number of ten the decrease is
at most five per cent of the value ofwhen there is no orificeit is suggested that the decrease ofbelow unity found in some experimental

this paper discusses the two major configurations that are usually
considered for achieving vtol while keeping the fuselage essentially
horizontalthat is, the tilt-wing and the deflected-slipstream
configurationsbecause of the high turning losses incurred by deflected-slipstream
configurations in hovering and because of the wing-stalling problem of
the pure tilt-wing configurations during the transition, it appears thatcombination of the two principles should be usedthis tilt-wing and
flap configuration should make use ofprogramed extensible-chord
slotted flap together withleading-edge high-lift device in order to
avoid the performance and handling qualities problems associated with
wing stalling during the transition while keeping the wing area as low
as possible for efficiency in cruising flight .pressure distribution and force measurements onvtol

pivot at 1.008 and 2.425 propeller diameters above the groundthe
slipstream of the propellers was deflected by tilting the wing and propellers,
by deflections of large-chord trailing-edge flaps, and by combinations
of flap deflection and wing tilttests were conducted overrange of propeller disk loadings from 7.41 to 29.70 pounds per square

that, for engineering purposes, the influence ofnacelle and ofpropeller, inusual combination, may
be considered to extend laterally onwing the same maximum

important effects of scale nacelle-propeller combinations
may be measured within practical limits of accuracy
by tests of15-foot-span wing .induced interference effects on jet and buried-fan
recent investigations of some jet and buried-fan configurations
have indicated that in the transition speed range, configurations with
considerable area surrounding the jet or buried fan can encounter large
losses in lift and nose-up pitching moments due to the pressures induced
on the lower surfaces by the interaction of the jet and free-stream
flowthe obvious way of minimizing these effects is to reduce the
surface area surrounding the jets or buried fans, that is, to consider
these effects in the preliminary stages of the airplane design .investigation of the effects of ground proximity and

the propeller thrust axis on the
wing chord plane, both the angle through
which the slipstream is deflected
and the ratio of resultant force
to thrust are reduced as the ground

the ground some of the loss in
resultant force is regainedlowering
the thrust axis below the wing

thrustthe addition of 10 incidence
between the thrust axis and the wing
increased the upward rotation
of the thrust vector about 10for the
same turning angle, the diving
moments associated with the slotted-flap
configurations were approximately
twice as large as the diving moments of
the configurations with plain

heating rates of blunt nose shapes at mach numbers up to 14data
obtained in flight and wind-tunnel tests have shown that the flat-faced
cylinder has about 50 percent the stagnation-point heating rates of the
hemisphere over nearly the entire mach number rangetests made atmach number ofonseries of bodies made up of hemispherical segments
 of varying radius of curvature showed that slight amounts of curvature
can decrease the local rates at the edge of the flat-faced cylinders
with onlyslight increase in the stagnation ratethe total heat
transfer to such slightly curved bodies is also somewhat smaller than
the total heat transfer to flat-faced cylinderscomparison of several tests with theoretical heating-rate distributions
showed that both laminar and turbulent local rates can be predicted by
available theories /given the pressure distribution about the body/
reasonably well, although the scatter of the available data still leaves
 open the choice between the theories at the edge of the bodies, where
they usually differtests onflat-faced cylinder atmach number of 2.49 and at angles

about 20 percent at 15degree angle of attackpreliminary results onconcave nose have indicated the possibility
that this type of design may be developed to give heating rates significantly
lower than even the flat-faced cylinder ratesthe test results
 have also shown, however, the existence of an unsteady flow phenomenon
which can increase the heating rates to extremely high values .numerical solutions for supersonic flow of an ideal

the shock wave indicated the existence
of an outward deflection of the flow

solution of problems of supersonic flow which can be solved by
existing first-order theorythe method of attack adopted is an
iteration process using the linearized solution as the first stepfor plane flow it is found thatparticular integral of the
iteration equation can be written down at once in terms of the
first-order solutionthe second-order problem is thereby
reduced to an equivalent first-order problem and can be readily
solvedat the surface of an isolated body, the solution reduces
to the well-known result of busemannthe plane case is
considered in some detail insofar as it gives insight into the
nature of the iteration processagain, for axially symmetric flow the problem is reduced tofirst-order problem by the discovery ofparticular integralfor smooth bodies, the second-order solution can then be calculated
by the method of von karman and moorebodies

both arbitraryalso indicated is an exact solution, applicable,
however, only to certain specific unsteady free-stream and surface
suction or injection variationsthe reliability and range
of validity of the integral solutions is then established on the
basis of numerical results from the exact solutionfinally,
several general qualitative conclusions of the unsteady effects
of free-stream velocity and surface suction or injection on laminar
boundary-layer behavior are made .on supersonic flow pastslightly yawing conethis paper is concerned
with the motion ofcircular cone, of
not too blunt an angle, through air at high
speedif the direction of motion of
the cone coincides with its axis of symmetry,
the resulting air flow is well knownhere we consider the perturbation produced
bysmall /yaw/--i.e., the case in
which the cone is moving not quite in the
direction of its axisthe results are
confirmed experimentally, and have applications
to ballistics, though we are not
concerned with the latter here,. they may
also be useful as providingcheck on
various approximate methods of wider
applicabilitythe square of the yaw is
neglected--an approximation of which the
validity is discussed(similar methods
can be applied to the second-order effects
of the yaw, which are also of ballistic
significance,. but the computations have not
yet been completed .)  it should be
observed that, because of the lack of symmetry,
the flow will be neither irrotational
nor isentropic .some research on high speed flutterpaper presents brief discussions of many topics currently of interest in

an electronic apparatus for automatic
evaluation of the damping ofharmonic
oscillation has been designed and constructedthe apparatus is based on the idea
of representing the harmonic damped
oscillation byrotating vector on the screen
ofcathode-ray tube in suchway, that
the rate of decrease of the length of the
vector ismeasure of the dampingthe
results are obtained simultaneously with
the oscillation test as two numbers in
decimal digits, which are inversely proportional
to the logarithmic decrement and
the frequency, respectivelythe apparatus,
which is named the /dampometer/,
has been used for some time for free
oscillation measurements of the dynamic
stability derivatives of aeroplane models
in windtunnels, and has proved to be very
satisfactoryit gives results of usually
higher accuracy than evaluation methods in
common use, and permitsmost considerable
saving of time .steady and fluctuating pressures at transonic speeds
steady and fluctuating pressures
have been measured at mach numbers
which were varied from 0.6 to 1.2 on
two bodies of revolution typical of
two space-vehicle payload shapes, the
centaur and the able.the results of the investigation
showed that significant fluctuations
of pressure occurred on both bodies
between mach numbers of 0.75 and 1.00the maximum fluctuations measured at
any mach number and angle of attack
occurred in the region of the normal
shock wave asresult of shockwave
motionlarge regions of unsteady
pressure also occurred asresult
of separation on the converging afterbody
of the able-v modelthe maximum
pressure fluctuations occurring on the
bodies increased with increasing
angle of attackfor angles other than
are indicated since pressure fluctuations
were larger on the upper half
of the bodies than on the lower halfno definite conclusions could be
drawn regarding the form of the
spectral densities of pressure fluctuations
in the region of the shock
wavethe spectral densities in regions
of separation following the
shock wave appeared flat except for some
increase in energy level below
due to slight model motions .measurements of aerodynamic forces for various mean
the oscillating air forces ontwo-dimensional wing oscillating
in pitch about the midchord have been measured at various
mean angles of attack and at mach numbers of 0.35 and 0.7the magnitudes of normal-force and pitching-moment coefficients
were much higher at high angles of attack than at low angles of
attack for some conditionslarge regions of negative damping
in pitch were found, and it was shown that the effect of increasing
the mach number from 0.35 to 0.7 was to decrease the initial
angle of attack at which negative damping occurredmeasurements of the aerodynamic damping of10-percentthick
and of3-percent-thick finite-span wing oscillating in
the first bending mode indicate no regions of negative damping
for this type of motion over the range of variables coveredthe
damping measured at high angles of attack was generally larger
than that at low angles of attack .general instability of stiffened cylinderstheoretical buckling stresses
are determined in explicit form for
circular cylinders with circumferential
and axial stiffeningthe
loadings are axial compression, radial
pressure, hydrostatic pressure,
and torsionanalyses were confined
to moderate-length and long cylindersthe investigation was based
upon the use ofform of donnell's
equation derived by taylor which is
applicable to orthotropic cylindersthe derivation of this equation is
presented in this report .stability of orthotropic cylindrical shells under combined
the increasing use of fiber and whisker reinforced
materials makes necessary the availability of
methods of analyzing cylinders and cones composed
of an orthotropic materialthis paper treats
the buckling of such shells undercombination
of axial compression and uniform external pressurethe differential equation approach of flugge is
used, and the resulting buckling equation is presented
in terms of axial and circumferential
bending rigidities, shear rigidity, poisson's ratio,
geometry parameters and mode shapesdesign
curves are presented which allow quick determination
of critical loads on cylinders, and, by using
the equivalent cylinder concept, on conical shells
of small included anglethe curves also lend
themselves to /tailoring/ of materials to fit the load
carrying requirements of the structure .elastic stability of orthotropic shellsa small-deflection theory for general instability of orthotropic
circular cylindrical shells has been derived for external pressure,
torsion, and axial compressionfor the first two types of loading,
comparison of the theory with experimental data for orthotropic
cylinders reveals agreement comparable with that obtained
for isotropic shellsfor axial compression, experimental
data have been found to agree reasonably well with theory for
orthotropic cylinders, in contrast to the agreement usually obtained
for isotropic cylinders .plastic stability theory of thin shellsconsiderable interest is currently centered on the
role of deformation and flow types of plasticity
theories in the solution of stability problemsfor
thin flat plates, deformation theory combined with
classical stability theory appears to yield results which
are in substantially good agreement with test dataon the other hand, flow or incremental theories appear
to require the introduction of initial imperfections in
order to obtainsatisfactory degree of correlation with
teststhus, in view of the current state of development of
plastic stability theory, it appears fruitful to exploit
the mathematical simplicity inherent in deformation
theory in the investigation of the plastic stability of
thin shellsalthough there may be theoretical objections
to deformation theories asclass, test data on
flat plates do suggest the predictive value of the results
obtained from this theoryin this paper,set of equilibrium differential equations
for the plastic buckling of thin shells of constant
unequal radii is derivedthis set of three equations
applies to flat plates, cylinders, and spheres under any
loading system leading to bucklingfor particular
problems such as buckling of cylinders under axial
compression, torsion or lateral pressure, and spheres
under external pressure, the set of equations can be
reduced tosingle eighth-order partial differential
equation of the donnell type in terms of the radial displacement
onlythese donnell-type equations are
used to obtain solutions for plastic buckling of spheres
under external pressure and long and moderate length
cylinders under lateral pressure or torsion loadsthe
limiting cases ofsimply supported flat plate under
compression or shear, represent the solutions for short
cylinders under lateral pressure or torsion, respectively .a unified theory of plastic buckling of columns and
on the basis of modern plasticity considerations,unified
theory of plastic buckling applicable to both columns and plates
has been developedfor uniform compression, the theory
shows that long columns which bend without appreciable
twisting require the tangent modulus and that long flanges
which twist without appreciable bending require the secant
modulusstructures that both bend and twist when they
buckle requiremodulus which iscombination of the secant
modulus and the tangent modulus .compressive and torsional buckling of thin-wall cylinders
based on assumptions which have
led to the best agreement between
theory and test data on inelastic buckling
of flat plates,general set
of equilibrium differential equations
for the plastic buckling of cylinders
has been derivedthese equations
have been used to obtain solutions
for the compressive and torsional
buckling of long cylinders in
the yield regiontest data are presented which indicate
satisfactory agreement with
the theoretical plasticity-reduction
factors in most caseswheredifference in results exists, test data
are in substantially better agreement
with the results obtained by use of
the maximum-shear law rather
than the octahedral-shear law to transform
axial stress-strain data to
shear stress-strain data .on the role of initial imperfections in plastic buckling
inrecent paper lee treated the complex problem of the
plastic buckling and postbuckling behavior of an axially compressed
cylindrical shell containing initial imperfections, representing
an important step forward in our understanding of this
common, yet perplexing, structural elementlee drew two
major conclusions ..  (a) even with initial imperfections the
incremental theory of plasticity considerably overestimates the
buckling strength as compared with the deformation theory,
which is in substantially good agreement with experiments, and
strength of cylindrical shells subject to axial compression are
significantit is the purpose of this note to discuss the second conclusion
in terms of lee's experimental and theoretical results, other experimental
data on inelastic buckling of 7075-t6 aluminumalloy
cylinders, and recent theoretical results on the inelastic
buckling of cylinders in the axisymmetric and circumferential
modesin particular, this writer does not believe that lee has
proved that initial imperfections are important for the group
of cylinders that he has testedon the contrary, it is believed
that initial imperfections are completely insignificant for this
group of cylinders although of probable significance in other
cases .an extension of donnell's equation forcircular cylindrical shellin 1933, donnell succeeded in simplifying the equations of equilibrium
forcircular cylindrical shell
he obtained simple relations between the critical buckling shearing
stress and the physical properties ofthin circular cylinder under
pure torsionhis approach reduces the tedious computations involved
in the classical solutions and is still in good agreement with themfurthermore, it is easy to show that the well-known classical solution
for critical compressive stress of the cylinder under axial compression

the bending ofbeam on an elastic
foundation and the axial symmetric displacement
ofcylinder,physical
insight is obtained for the buckling of
cylindrical shells under axial compressionthe technique is equivalent
to classical small deflection theory
and provides good agreement with the more
elaborate solutions for the buckling

and orthotropic cylinders,
including the effects of internal pressure
or an elastic core .the buckling of sandwich type panelsfifty-one flat rectangular sandwich-type panels were tested
in edgewise compression with the unloaded edges of the panels
restrained by v-groovesthe sandwich consisted of papreg
faces andcellular cellulose acetate corethe thickness of the
faces varied from 0.00675 to 0.02025 in.,. the core, from 0.066
to 0.741 in.,. the width of the panel, fromto 11 inthe length
of the panel was always 10.5 inthe buckled shape consisted ofripple of short wave length across the panelit was either
symmetric, the two faces bulging out symmetrically according
to sine curves, or skew, the two faces deflecting in the same sense
according to sine curves havingphase angle of 90a strain energy theory of buckling is presented for both the
symmetric and the skew cases, and the buckling load in the symmetric
case is also calculated by integration of the differential
equationthe agreement between the theoretic and the experimental
buckling stress is reasonable, that between the predicted
and actual buckled shape gooda simple formula is developed
which permitschoice of the most suitable core material when the
mechanical properties of the face material are given .face wrinkling and core strength in sandwich constructionthe effect of initial waviness on the wrinkling of
faces in sandwich construction is studiedformulae are
derived to determine the failing stress when the faces
wrinkle due to failure of the core in tension, compression
or shearthe importance of core strength requirements
in maintaining surface smoothness is noteda comparison
of theory with experiments is made, and the agreement
between the two is found to be reasonably goodthe strength of the corewilliams has related the strength
of the core in tension and shear to an arbitrarily assumed
initial irregularity which, to ensure laminar flow inwing
is assumed to havemaximum admissible value (initial
wave amplitude critical wavelength=0.0005 to 0.001) .general instability ofring stiffened circular cylindrical

from the beginning of loading and (2) active only at the onset

critical load for the nonaxisymmetric type buckling may be very
large for type (1) restraintdesign curves are included forrange ofd.and restraint stiffnessresults are of doubtful
value considering the known inadequacy of the linear theory of
buckling under axial compression .general instability of ring stiffened cylindrical shells

subjected to external hydrostatic pressure, and the observed
general instability strengths compared with predictions
from theories of kendrick and nashagreement with kendrick
was found rather goodresults also are presented from electrical

elastic general instability pressure of ring-stiffened cylindrical
shells subject to external hydrostatic pressure may be determinedan
actual application of the method is illustrated in the paper and the
results of several other examples are summarized .torispherical shellsa caution to designersit has recently become apparent, throughrigorous stress analysis ofspecific case
that designing torispherical shells by the
current edition of the asme code on unfired
pressure vessels can lead to failure during
proof-testing of the vesselthe purpose
of the present paper is to show in what
respects the code fails to give accurate resultsas an illustrative example,hypothetical
pressure vessel withtorispherical head
havingdiameter-thickness ratio of 440 was
selectedthe supports of the vessel were
considered to be either on the main cylinder
or around the torusthe vessel was subjected
to internal pressure and the elastic
stresses in it were determined rigorously and
by the codea comparison of the two
revealed that the code predicted stresses in the
head which were less than one half of those
actually occurringfurthermore, the code
gave no indication of the presence of high
compressive circumferential direct stresses
which exceeded 30,000 psi for practically
the entire torusif the head had been fabricated
usingsteel withyield point of
would have failed or undergone large
deformations, whereas the code would have predicted
that it was safethe code's rules
for torispherical heads are thus in need of
revision for certain geometriesthe
implications of the foregoing results are currently
being studied by the asme,. in the interim,
however, designers should exercise care in
applying the code to torispherical shellsit is also shown in the paper that the use
of the membrane state asparticular solution
of the differential equations is notgood approximation for toroidal shells of the
type considered .limit analysis of symmetrically loaded thin shells

of rotationally symmetric small deflection of thin toroidal
elastic shellshe first reduces the problem to that of integratingsingle linear nonhomogeneous ordinary differential
equation involving two parametersasymptotic formulae
for the complementary function are obtained by applying
the general method of langer (trans.amer.math.soc.33,
advantage of yielding results valid near the points where
the tangent plane is perpendicular to the axis of revolution,
where the methods of asymptotic integration customary in
shell theory fail (see the preceding review)for two problems
in which only the complementary function is required,
the author's results are compared with those obtained by
wissler (dissertation, zurich, 1916) bymethod of power
series expansion,. the agreement is withinor betterthe
author observes that the usual method of obtaining asymptotic
expressions forparticular integral, being based on
using as an approximation the complementary function
obtained from the membrane theory, will fail near points
where the tangent plane is perpendicular to the axis of
revolutionhe therefore introducesnew method, which
he states was developed jointly with e. reissnerhe applies
his results to the cases of an joint loaded symmetrically
and parallel to its axis,corrugated pipe subject to axial
load, andcorrugated cylinder subject to axial pressuremany numerical calculations are involved and there are two
tables of functions occuring in the solutions .asymptotic solutions of toroidal shell problemsmethod of asymptotic integration developed by e. reissner and
author is refined, and solutions previously obtained for problems
of bending of curved tube and oftoroidal expansion joint subject
to an axial force are generalized and extendedresults are
compared to those obtained by l. beskinfor large values ofcertain parameter, agreement is good .the effect of entrance velocity on the flow ofrarefied
the flow ofrarefied gas throughcircular tube is consideredmolecules entering the tube havemass velocity directed down
the tube, as well asrandomly directed thermal velocityit is
assumed that the conditions for free-molecule flow hold, and that
molecules striking the tube wall are reflected diffuselythe
mass velocity and tube dimensions are restricted only by the
limitation to free-molecule flowthe theory is illustrated by an
example of the effect of an entrance tube on the measurement of
pressure and density bygage placed onsatelite .shock-standoff distance for spherical bodies at high
usaf-sponsored development ofsimple expression for shockstandoff
distance, by consideration of an apropriate specific-heat
ratio behind the shockthe theory gives predictions which are almost
as accurate as those of the van dyke and hays methods .the wake behind an oscillating vehiclethe incompressible laminar far wake behind an oscillating
vehicle is analyzed with the use of the oseen linearization, and
the assumption that the wake cross section is axisymmetrictime-wise drag variations are thus represented as changes in the
wake diameter and velocity defectit is shown that the unsteadiness
in this flow can be predicted byquasi-steady theory .effect of wall divergence on sonic flows in solid wall
the effect of wall divergence (in excess of the normal
value given for compensating the boundary layer growth
on the tunnel walls), on the simulation of sonic flows in
solid wall wind tunnels is presented in this note which iscondensed version of ref..a one-foot hypervelocity shock tunnel in which high-enthalpyshock tunnel is described in
which high-enthalpy, real-gas air
flows can be generated with flow times
of about 180 millisecondsthis
shock tunnel is operated withcombustionheated
driver gas and consists
ofcombustion chamber, shock tube,
supersonic nozzle, test section, and
vacuum tankan essential feature of
this shock tunnel ismeans for
achievingconstant-pressure air reservoir

achieved atmach number of about 10the corresponding stream total
enthalpy is about 4,500 btu lb and the
stagnation pressure is 3.25 psia .slipstream flow around several tilt-wing vtol aircraft modelscollection of data fromnumber of brief investigations made with
three different models to determine the character of the slipstream flow
along the ground is presented for multiple-propeller tilt-wing vtol aircraft
configurations operating near the groundin general, the tests
involved tuft surveys and slipstream dynamic-pressure measurements for
several tilt-wing vtol modelsa more extensive series of tests,
including some measurements of the erosion of gravel by the slipstream
and some measurements of the unsteady rolling, yawing, and pitching
moments, was also made on one of the models operating in the hovering
condition near the groundthe results of the flow studies indicated the presence ofstronger
and deeper slipstream flow along the center line of the aircraft, and to
some extent along parallel planes between adjacent propellers (on one
wing), than to the side of the aircraftthis effect is caused by an
intensification of the individual slipstreams as they meet at the planes
of flow symmetrythe intensified flow along the center line of the
aircraft is amplified by the presence of the fuselage and causes the
dynamic pressure to be greater in front of the aircraft than would be
expected on the basis of the slipstream of the individual propellersin the erosion tests it was found that gravel, if sufficiently small,
was rapidly eroded by the slipstream and that this gravel could be
thrown high into the air if it struck even very small fixed obstacles on
the ground (obstacles withheight less than the diameter of the
gravel)results of the investigation of moment fluctuations
indicated that there are large, erratic variations of rolling, yawing,
and pitching moments and that the propellers, reacting to an erratic
inflow from the recirculating slipstream, are the primary source of
these moments .buckling of core-stabilized cylinders under axisymmetric external

cylindercomparison is made with results of previous theoretical
and experimental investigations, where available .thermal buckling of cylindersseveral theoretical and experimental investigations on the buckling
of cylinders due to both axial and circumferential thermal stresses are
revieweddifferences that exist among the various results are discussed
and areas of future work are indicated .heat transfer to bodies traveling at high speed in the uppergeneral method has been developed, using the methods of kinetic
theory, whereby the surface temperatures of bodies can be calculated for
steady flight at any speed inrarefied gasthe particular solution
was made forflat plate., however, the calculations can be easily
extended to bodies of arbitrary shapeit was found that the aerodynamic heating problem in the absence of
solar radiation, that is, for the case of nocturnal flight, becomes of
negligible importance at altitudes of 125 miles and higher and up to
steady flight speeds of 36,000 feet per secondthe effect of solar
radiation, for the case of daytime flight, becomes increasingly
important as the flight altitude is increasedat an altitude of 150
miles and higher, solar radiation is the predominating factor that
determines skin temperatureowing to the strong effect of solar
radiation on skin temperatures at high altitudes, the desirability of
nocturnal flight is indicated in order to minimize skin temperaturesin order to maintain low skin temperatures, it was found that the
angle of inclination of the body with respect to the flight path should
be kept as small as possiblethis may be accomplished in practice
by designing the body to be finely tapered and by flying the body at
small angles of attackit is pointed out that skin temperatures may be reduced by insuring
thermal contact between portions of the skin inclined at positive
and negative angles with respect to the flight pathas much surface
as possible should be inclined at negative anglespractically,
this may be accomplished by boattailing the bodyin the event that an internal skin-cooling system is employed, it is
shown that the rate of internal cooling must be of the same order of
magnitude or greater than the rate at which heat is lost naturally
by emitted radiationif the cooling rate is below the natural
radiation rate, cooling has little effect upon skin temperaturesit is shown that, in the case ofmissile designed to fly overwide
range of altitudes and speeds, it is desirable to make the emissivity
of the skin as high as possiblethis conclusion, however, is
based uponskin surface for which the emissivity is independent
of the wave length of the emitted and absorbed radiant energya possible method of reducing surface temperatures is indicated by
the decrease in skin temperature which accompaniesdecrease in
thermal accommodation coefficientthis phenomenon may be
used to advantage if it is possible to decrease the accommodation
coefficient by altering the surface characteristics of the skin .knudsen flow throughcircular capillarythe problem of knudsen flow throughcircular capillary has been
often discussed, usually by the momentum transfer methodhowever,
p. clausing gaverigorous formulation for the problem and obtained an
integral equation for which he gave an approximate solutionfrom
time to time the accuracy of clausing's solution has been questioned
and since clausing did not giverigorous estimate of his error we
have reinvestigated the problem .similar temperature boundary layersconditions for the existence of similar solutions are known for (a) twodimensional,
incompressible, steady and nonsteady laminar boundary
layers and (b) three-dimensional, incompressible, steady, laminar
boundary layers forbody of revolution rotating influid at rest orbody of revolution inrotating fluid flowcorresponding conditions
for the existence of similar temperature boundary layers in
both cases are given for constant and variable wall temperaturesthe
general conclusion is that, in all these cases, with or without viscous
heating, and with constant wall temperature, conditions for the existence
of similar velocity boundary layers are at the same time the
conditions for the existence of similar temperature boundary layersif the wall temperature is variable, the conditions for the existence
of similar velocity boundary layers are at the same time the conditions
for the existence of similar temperature boundary layers if the
wall temperature varies aspower of the local free-stream velocity
or surface velocitynumberical solutions are given for the nondimensional
temprature distributions function and the nondimensional temperature
gradient at the wall for several prandtl numbers in the case

the inviscid flow between the detached shock wave and the surface ofblunt body travelling at supersonic speeddetailed experimental
data are needed for comparisonexperiments have been made in the
supersonic wind tunnels of the jet propulsion laboratory on spheres,
disks, and blunted cones over the mach number range 1.8 to 5.0 in airsurface pressures, shock wave shape and detachment distance, certain
velocity gradients, the sonic line location, and some streamline paths
were determinedthe sonic line is found as the trace of the termination
point ofweak shock generated byprobe ahead of the modelforsphere, good agreement between theory (of van dyke) and experiment
is found .on periodically oscillating wakes in the oseen approximationstudies in mathsand mechs .,the oscillating vortex wake behind an obstacle at
reynolds numbers of order 10 is studied by means of the
oseen approximation .a study of the simulation of flow with free stream mach numberinthe degree to which experimental results obtained under choking conditions
inwind tunnel with solid walls simulate those associated with
an unbounded flow with free-stream mach numberis investigated for the
 cases of two-dimensional and axisymmetric flowsit is found thatclose resemblance does indeed exist in the vicinity of the body, and
that the results obtained in this way are generally at least as accurate
 as those obtained intransonic wind tunnel with partly open test
sectionsome of the results indicate, however, that substantial interference
effects, particularly those of the wave reflection type, may
be encountered under certain conditions, both in choked wind tunnels and
 in transonic wind tunnels, and that the reduction of these interference
 effects to acceptable limits may require the use of models of unusually
 small size .on the influence of wall boundary layers in closed transonic test sections
the boundary layers at the test section walls oftransonic wind tunnel
 are known to reduce the wall interferencein the present paper this
effect is studied by means of small perturbation theory, assuming viscosity
to be negligible when perturbingturbulent boundary layeran
approximation for thin boundary layers leads tomodified boundary
condition at the wall of the test section, expressing the normal
streamline slope induced by changes in mass flow density and crossflow
within the boundary layerthis boundary condition is applied to the
linearized equations of subsonic flow and to the non-linear transonic
equations at choking, the cases of plane and circular test sections only
 being treated in detailthe results of linear theory show that all corrections except the
three-dimensional angle-of-attack correction are considerably reduced by
 the presence of the boundary layers at mach numbers greater than 0.9,
the essential part of their influence being due to the change of mass
flow density with pressurein the case of choking the analysis indicates
that the presence of boundary layers will increase the maximum
model size for which the flow can be interpreted as corresponding to
mach number one in free flightfinally, the technique of using artificial
thickening of the wall boundary layers forreduction of wall
interference is considered, though without reachingdefinite conclusion
as to its value as compared to other techniques .some experimental investigations on the influence of wall boundary
pressure distribution measurements and drag determination by means of
balance measurements have been carried out fornumber of models at
high subsonic velocity in wind tunnels, where the boundary layer of the
walls has been variedwithin the investigated range it appeared thatthickening of the boundary layer reduced the disturbing influence of
the walls, which also caused an increase of the choking mach numberthe phenomenon described should be ofcertain importance from the
point of view of wind tunnel technique, since it is possible to increase
 the choking velocity forgiven model by means of thickening the
boundary layer .experimental investigation of attenuation of strong

little effect on the attenuation rate ofshock wave of given strength
for the pressure range investigatedthe
static-pressure measurements
indicated thatsevere pressure gradient

various heights above the ground, the
lift, drag, and pitching moment
were measured and tuft studies were
made to determine the flow field
caused by the propeller slipstreamdata were obtained for the complete
model, for the model with horizontal
tail removed, and for the wingpropeller
combination alonethe results of the investigation
showed that, when the model was
hovering near the ground, there wasstrong upwash in the plane of
symmetry and also an increase in lift
of about 10 percent of the propeller
thrustabout one-half of this
lift resulted from an increase
in propeller thrust and one-half resulted
from an up load on the fuselage
induced by the upwashas the model
approached the ground, it also
experienced an increasing nose-down
pitching moment that evidently
resulted from the up load on the fuselage,
the rear part of which was
longer than the front partthe addition
of the horizontal tail which
was located about halfway up the vertical
tail did not increase the
nose-down pitching moment because the
fuselage decreased the energy of
the upwash before it reached the tail .an investigation of the effect of downwash fromvtol
dynamic-pressure measurement,
in ground effect, have been obtained
aboutsingle-rotor helicopter anddual-propeller vtol aircraftthe
results indicate that the slipstream
dynamic pressure along the ground,
some distance from the center of
rotation, is notfunction of disk
loading but merelyfunction of
the gross weight or thrust of the aircraftfurthermore, forgiven
gross weight the thickness of this outward
flowing sheet of air is less
forsmall-diameter propeller (higher
disk loading propeller)the variation of the dynamic-pressure
flow field for single and
dual propellers or rotors is significantly
different in the plane of
symmetry between the two rotors than
indirection normal to this
planethe interaction of the two
flows producesregion of upflow
in this plane where the fuselage is
located, and the decay of the maximum
dynamic pressure with distance
ahead of the fuselage is slower .an investigation to determine conditions under which
results of an investigation with
small-scale equipment of the conditions
under which the downwash fromhovering vertical-take-off-andlanding

one-half the exit-area loadingthe
surface dynamic pressure decreases
rapidly with increasing height of the
vtol deviceerosion of sand and loose dirt
started at surface dynamic pressures

agreement with helicopter experiencethoroughly soaking the sand and
loose-dirt surfaces increased the
resistance to erosion to surface dynamic

dynamic pressures of 1.5 to
pressures up to about 1,000 lb sq ft .an experimental study of the effect of downwash fromfull-scale, twin-propeller

to 90 was an area of poor visibilitystatic operation in the presence
of loose surface material indicated
that the downwash cleared the

small dents and fabric punctures
in the sides of the fuselagethe propeller-blade erosion was
superficial except for the leading
edges where several layers of glass
fiber were eroded .damage incurred ontilt-wing multipropeller vtol/stolsummary is presented of the
damage experienced bytilt-wing
vtol stol aircraft asresult of
operating fromlevel surface covered
with loose gravelthe damage was
inadvertently incurred as the aircraft
was performingtaxiing-turn maneuver
over an area of level macadam surface
containing loose and embedded
crushed stoneobservers fromchase
aircraft commented that the wing was
tilted at approximately 76 with
respect to the ground when the damage
occurreddeposits of stone in the
open fuselage, punctures in the rotor
blade skin, and damage to the compressor
blades of the engine occurred
due to the circulation of the
crushed gravel .hangling qualities experience with several vtol research
all of the vtol research aircraft
discussed in this paper have successfully
demonstrated conversion from
hovering to airplane flight and
vice versahowever, control about one
or more axes of these aircraft
has been inadequate in hovering flightfurthermore, ground interference
effects have been severe in some cases
and have accentuated the inadequacy
of control in hovering and very low
speed flightstalling of wing surfaces has resulted
in limitations in level-flight
deceleration and in descent, particularly
for the tilt-wing aircraft, which
in this case isvery rudimentary typeminor modifications to the wing
leading edge have, however, produced
surprisingly large and encouraging
reductions in adverse stall effectsheight control in hovering and in
low-speed flight has proved to
beproblem for the aircraft not having
direct control of the pitch of
the rotorsthe other systems have shown
undesirable time lags in
development ofthrust change .structural loads surveys on two tilt-wing vtol configurationsthe results of two structural-loads
surveys are summarizedthe
first loads program discussed concerns
the airframe vibratory loads
encountered during flight tests of the
vz-2 tilt-wing vtol aircraft
throughout the operational range from
hover to cruise flightthe
primary sources of airframe vibration
were wing-stall buffeting and
tail buffeting in descentsthe second
loads program discussed concerns
the initial results ofstructural-loads survey conducted as
part of the wind-tunnel test oflarge-scale tilt-wing research modelthis loads program deals with the
steady wing loads measured throughout
simulated transition from hover to
cruise .the stability under axial compression and lateral pressure
the stability under axial compression and lateral pressure offinite circular-cylindrical shell with an elastic core is treated by
means of donnell's equationsthe stability criterion is investigated
in detail for the general cylinder under axial compression or
lateral pressure and forparticular cylinder under combined
loadingcomparisons are made with available experimental
data .elastic stability of circular cylindrical shells stabilized
the effect ofsoft elastic core upon the
buckling strength ofthin, circular, cylindrical shell is
investigated experimentallytwo types of loading are
considered ..  (a) axial compression, and (b) uniform radialband
loading, where the width of the band is small compared
to the length of the shellfor each type of loading it is shown that the strengthening
effect of the elastic core becomes more significant
with the increasing values of the radius-thickness ratiofor example, it is shown that for the geometric and elastic
constants considered it is possible, with the presence
of the core, to increase the axial buckling stress by as
much as 65 percent over the values found for those without
an elastic corethe elastic core is even more effective
in stabilizing the shell against buckling due to band
loading, the peak pressure required to buckle the filled
specimen being 7.30 times that required to buckle the
unfilled shell .the buckling of cylindrical shells under longitudinally varying loadstwo problems illustrating the effect of nonuniformity of loading
on the buckling characteristics of circular cylinders are
investigatedthe first problem deals with the effect of
linearly varying axial compressive stress, such as would be
produced by the weight of the propellant insolid-propellant
engine casethe results indicate that the ratio of the maximum
critical compressive stress induced by the shear load to the
critical uniform compressive stress varies from 1.9 for
the curvature parameterequal to 1.6 asbecomes infinitein particular, the increase in stress is
less than 20 per sq. ft. forgreater than 100the stability of thin cylinders loaded by lateral external
pressure varying linearly in the longitudinal direction is also
investigatedthe results indicate that forgreater than 100,
the buckling coefficients are proportional to square
root.general theory of bucklingvarious aspects of the theory of buckling are expounded
in many treatises (1 to 15)the books of bleich (2)
and salmon (3) contain large bibliographiesgoodier
developments in buckling theorynumerous references are
appended to hoff's articlenearly all publications on buckling
of shells, available in the u.s.a. (to 1956), are listed in
the bibliographies on shells by nash (18)the section
ready guide to recent literature .stresses from local loadings in cylindrical pressureshort discussion is given of the possible methods for
computing the stresses caused in cylindrical shells by local
loadingsit is concluded that the method of developing
the loads and displacements into double fourier series
leads to formulas which are best suited for numerical
evaluationwith this method the pertinent expressions
for the displacements caused by radial loads are found by
reducing the three partial differential equations of the
shell theory to an eighth-order differential equation in the
radial displacements, which is similar to, but not identical
with, those derived by donnell and yuaninsertion of the
fourier series for the radial displacements and the external
loading in this equation leads directly todouble series
expression of the radial displacementin terms of the load
factors of the radial loadthis results in the pertinent
expressions for the other displacements and for the bending
moments and membrane forcesthe cases of radial
loading considered here and those which can be reduced to
it are (a)load uniformly distributed withinrectangle,
tion, uniformly distributed overshort distance in the
circumferential direction, (d)moment in the circumferential
direction, uniformly distributed overshort
distance in the longitudinal directionfor all these loadings
the load factors, which have to be used in the
pertinent formulas for the displacements, bending moments,
and membrane forces, are computedfor the case
of tangential loading an eighth-order differential equation
is derived in terms of the radial displacement and the
tangential loadusing this equation, formulas for the displacements,
bending moments, and membrane forces for
tangential loading withinrectangle are found .bending tests of ring-stiffened circular cylinderstwenty-five ring-stiffened circular
cylinders were loaded to failure
in bendingthe results are
presented in the form of design curves
which are applicable to cylinders with
heavy rings that fail asresult
of local buckling .effects of rapid heating on strength of airframe componentsresults of several experimental
investigations are presented which
indicate the effects of rapid heating
on the bending strength of multiweb
beams and ring-stiffened cylindersit is shown that thermal stresses
reduce the bending load carried at
buckling by both beams and cylindersthe influence of thermal stress on
maximum load is found to depend
largely on the mode of bucklingfor beams that buckle locally, no
apparent effect of thermal stress on
the maximum load has been founda reduction in maximum load has been
observed for beams that buckle in
the wrinkling mode and for cylinders .buckling of ring-stiffened cylinders underpure bending
thirteen stainless-steel ring-stiffened
cylinders were subjected topure
bending load and heated rapidly until
buckling occurredfor most of the cylinders
the heating was not uniform around
the circumference so that appreciable
axial thermal stresses were presentelementary thermal stress theory was found
to be inadequate for the prediction of
these thermal stresses, butmethod was
developed that would give satisfactory
thermal stress resultsby properly
accounting for the thermal stress, the
buckling load could be correlated withtheory for the buckling of an axially
compressed ring-stiffened cylinder that is
uniformly heated .a theory of asymmetric hypersonic blunt-body flowstwo-dimensional asymmetric and three-dimensional
inviscid blunt-body flows are analyzed

infinity to 1.85the ratio of specific heats, is taken
as 1.4comparison with results obtained
using van dyke's and garabedian's numerical
solutions indicates that the method under
consideration is more accurate than the van dyke
method for determining stand-off distancesolutions are obtained for parabolic and paraboloidal
shock waves at small angle of attack and
infinite freestream mach number,. assumes the
values 1.4, 1.2, 1.1, and 1.05for all cases,
the streamline that wets the body passes through
the shock wave slightly above the point
where the shock is normal and thus does not possess
maximum entropythese results provide
counter examples to the conjecture that any
isolated convex body insupersonic stream
is wetted by the streamline of maximum entropy .approximate analysis of the slot injection ofgas

wall and to constant wall enthalpy are discussedthe injection of homogeneous, heterogeneous,
nonreactive, and reactive gases is
treatedfor the latter case, the models usually
employed for chemical behavior, namely,
frozen and equilibrium flow, are consideredthe
analysis is applicable towide variety of
laminar flows, e.g., those involving cooling, thermal
protection, skin-friction reduction, and
supersonic deflagrationa numerical example of
practical interest in connection with the
venting of gaseous hydrogen boiloff fromrocket
booster is presented .steady magnetohydrodynamic flow pastnon-conducting
this paper presentsstudy of the steady twodimensional
magnetohydrodynamic flow of an
infinitely conducting fluid pastnonconducting
wedge with nonaligned flow and magnetic
fieldthe flows considered are in the /superfast/
or fully hyperbolic regimethe flows consist
of several regions of uniformity connected by
shocks and expansion wavesbecause of the
boundary condition on the magnetic field, the
magnetic field must be the same in the regions
above and below the wedge,. thus the flows in these
regions are coupled, unlike in the case of ordinary
supersonic gasdynamicsonly small wedge
angles and weak waves (characteristics) are
consideredthe problem thus is linearized, and
explicit solutions are obtained which are
qualitatively similar to the nonlinear solutionssome interesting and unexpected features
arise, and they are discussed in detail .an approximate solution for laminar boundary layer flowthis paper presents an approximate solution for two-dimensional,
incompressible, laminar boundary layer flow with arbitrary pressure
gradientvon mises' form of the boundary layer equation is linearized
by makingchange in the coefficient of one of the termsthe linearized
equation yieldssolution that is accurate for the outer portion
of the flow but inaccurate near the surfacea separate inner solution
then is developed which is accurate at the surface and which joins with
the outer solution at some point within the boundary layerthe
method may be consideredmajor modification of one developed earlier
by von karman and millikan, with changes in both outer and inner solutions,
and the point at which the two solutions are joinedthe changes
improve the accuracy of the method and in some respects simplify the
calculationsas examples, results are presented for flow withlinear variation of velocity (including flat plate and stagnation
point flow as special cases), flow with sinusoidal variation of
velocity, flow pastcircular cylinder (heimenz' velocity
distribution), and flow past an ellipse (schubauer's data)agreement
with theoretically exact solutions is good, and better than
results obtained using the pohlhausen method .laminar hypersonic trail in the expansion-conduction
the usual procedure in calculating the cooling
process inwake behindblunt object is to
assumeregion of pure expansion up todistance
where the pressure has reached its ambient
value, followed byregion where the mechanism
of pure heat conduction is operativein
the present paper both mechanisms are assumed
to be valid simultaneously, and the result is
compared with previous calculationsthe
following criterion is established ..  the minimum
radius ofhemisphere-cylinder configuration,
above whichsimultaneous conductionexpansion

the approximation
where is the nondimensional value
of the enthalpy at the axis of the wake below
which the two methods of computation give the
same result, andis the flight mach number .three dimensional effects in viscous wakesthree-dimensionality in wakelike or jetlike
free mixing may stem from initial geometric
configurations, nonuniformities in flow variables
overcross section, or boundary conditions
along the flowthese may be generated by
bodies at angle of attack, nonaxisymmetric
bodies, mixing of nonaxisymmetric jets with
an outer flow, finite wings, or more artificial
meansthis paper is devoted to studies bearing
on such configurationsthe first section
deals with the general mathematical model, in
which the boundary layer approximations
are used, and with methods of solutionlaminar and turbulent flow, compressibility, unsteadiness,
and streamwise pressure gradients
are admitted initiallythe flux forms of the
equations are givenalgebraic integrals of the
energy equations and the diffusion (frozenflow)
equations are obtaineda simplification
of the convective terms, roughly corresponding
to the oseen approximation, is used
in the asymptotic downstream regionthe second section contains explicit solutions
for specific configurations, in particular
for flows whose initial isovels are of elliptic shapethese flows may be wakelike or jetlikecompressibility is admitted,. however, the flows
must have uniform pressure and must be
steadythe final section deals with interpretation
and evaluation of the results .an integral method for calculating heat and mass transfer
an integral method previously used successfully
in several kinds of boundary layer problems
has been extended to treat simultaneous heat and
mass transfer inbinary-mixture laminar
boundary layer when the pressure is uniformthe principal results are two pairs of dual integral
relations arising from solutions to the
integral concentration and energy equationsone pair connects the surface mass transfer rate
and surface concentration of injected gas,. the
other relates surface temperature and heat transfer
rate in the presence of mass transferonly the cases of helium and air injection into an
undissociated air stream are discussed in
detail, but the method can be applied to problems
involving other gasesthe approximate
results agree quite well with some numerical solutions
and with recent experimental results
for which no numerical solutions are available .lift of slender delta wings according to newtonian
an approximate system of equations is derived to
describe the inviscid flow pastflat slender
wing at angle of attack, in the limit andthe aspect ratio is required to
approach zero at the same rate as the mach angle in
the flow behind the shock waveonlysingle parameter appears in the resulting equations,
andsimilarity law therefore can be
written expressingcorrection to the newtonian
normal-force coefficientfor the delta wing,correlation of experimental data according to the
similarity law is shown, and the first terms
of the solution are derived under the assumption
that the similarity parameter is small (vertex
angle much smaller than mach angle) .shock-induced boundary layer separation in overexpanded conical exhaust
the flow in overexpanded supersonic nozzles is reviewedalthough five
essentially different flow regimes can be discerned, depending on the
nozzle pressure ratio, the regime of most interest to the engine designer
is the one characterized by oblique shock patterns in the nozzle
and flow separation from the nozzle wallit is shown that the pressure
 rise associated with the separation correlates well with the mach number
at the separation pointa simple analytical formulation for the
pressure rise required to separate the flow provides excellent agreement
 with experimental data overwide range of nozzle operating conditions
 and allows prediction of overexpanded nozzle performance .factors affecting lift-drag ratios at mach numbers

method are presented and used to calculate
lift-drag ratios of flat-top conical wing-body
arrangements at mach numbers fromto 20viscous interaction effects are considered, but
bluntness effects are neglectedcorrelations

the chemically reacting flow pastwedgethe
freestream is either in equilibrium or out of
equilibrium but nonreactingthe attached
shock wave is shown to be either concave, convex,
or straight, depending on the values of the

formthe half-range analysis previously employed for
parallel plate geometrics (symmetric
problems) can be adapted to the single-plate problemalthough the mathematical analysis
differs, the slip coefficients are essentially identical
with those obtained from the parallel
plate problem (e.g., couette flow)detailed calculations
are presented for both hard sphere
and maxwellian moleculesthe recent work of
bakanov and deryagin for hard sphere

and elliptic fields are superimposed,
are consideredresults of grad, mccune and
resler, and sears and resler are extended and
considered in detail for the case of an arbitrarily
inclined unperturbed fieldthe general solution
contains four line singularities along the
characteristics through the ends of the body and
has two arbitrary constantsby/generalized
kutta-joukowski condition,/ these constants
are fixed so that two of the line singularities
disappearspecifically, it is required that the
solution be locally square integrablebehavior
of the exponents of the singularities is investigated
by numerical computation and, in limiting
cases, analyticallythe singular parts of some flows
are investigated numerically .experiments with two-dimensional, transversely impinging
experiments on the interaction of transversely
impinging two-dimensional jet flows were
performed in whichlow pressure control jet
flow interacted withrelatively high pressure
power jet flowthe ratio of the control jet to
the power jet supply chamber gauge stagnation
pressure was adjusted at 0, 10, and 15shadowgraphs of the power jet alone, as well as the
corresponding interacting jet flows, were
recorded to establish the nature of and changes in
the shock structurethe jet flows were
traversed bypitot tube to record the pitot pressure
distributions at various locations downstream
of the power jet exitit was discovered that
with the addition of onlysmall percent
control jet flow, the normal shock front of the highly
underexpanded power jet flow changed to
an oblique shock structure and, downstream of the
previous location of the normal shock which
appeared in the power jet flow alone, the maximum
recovery stagnation pressures were
proportionally much higherthe mechanism for
this behavior of the normal shock is proposedpossible practical importance of this behavior
of interacting jet flows with reference to aerodynamic
noise, supersonic diffuser losses, etc., is
also pointed outfor the power jet flow alone it
was found that by considering the actual jet
boundaries as simply an extension of the actual
nozzle, the average axial flow quantities, computed
from the area-mach number relation using
the observed cross-sectional area of the jet
flow, agreed quite favorably with the experimental results .growth of the turbulent wake behindsupersonic sphereexperimental data are presented on the growth
of turbulent wakes up to 8000 calibers behind

forces for slender supersonic aircraft on
the basis of slender-body theoryparticular
consideration is given to configurations which
are spanwise flexibleto treat configurations

intervalwith this approach, it is not necessary
to apply conformal mapping techniques,
and the solution so obtained is valid for arbitrary
spanwise downwash distributionson the
basis of slender-body theory, the velocity potential
and, subsequently, the generalized aerodynamic
forces are derived forgeneral class of
spanwise flexible wing-body configurations .the blunt-leading-edge problem in hypersonic flowthe present paper is mainly concerned with
the hypersonic flow overflat plate withblunt nosethe analysis is based on the flow
model in which the flow field behind the shock
wave may be divided into two regions ..  the
inviscid-hypersonic-flow region and the entropy
layer, across which the pressure has no appreciable
changethe equations for the entropy
layer can be reduced to those of the usual
boundary-layer problem with the exception that
the outer edge of the entropy layer, as well
as the pressure remain unknownthese unknowns
are determined so as to approximately
match the entropy-layer solution with the inviscid
hypersonic solution in which the shock
wave has the shape of the power law of the
distance from the leading edgethe assumed
flow model is shown to be valid overrestricted
range depending on the wall-to-stagnation
temperature ratio and (where is
the reynolds number based on half the thickness
of nose t,the freestream mach number,
andthe chapman-rubesin constantactual calculations have been carried out for the
case with typical values of and
the wall-to-stagnation temperature ratiothe calculated values for both the surface
pressure and heat-transfer rate are compared
with the experimental dataas regards surface
pressure in particular,satisfactory agreement
with the data is obtainedthe validity
of the assumptions upon which the present
analysis is based has been examined from the
numerical results, and the region of the validity
has been found to extend overcertain large range
of the nondimensional distance from the
leading edge .theoretical investigations ofsupersonic laminar
the phenomena arising from the uniform injection of helium,
air, argon, and iodine into the laminar boundary layer ofsupersonic
stream of air intube were investigated theoreticallythe partial differential equations describing the energy, mass,
and momentum transfers through the boundary layer were obtained,
andseries solution was found for the case of uniform
injection through the tube wallthe results of the analysis are
in the form of axial distributions of wall temperature and recovery
factor and of radial distribution of concentration, velocity,
static, and stagnation temperaturesthe gas mixture
was assumed to beperfect gasproperties of the mixture were
calculated in accordance with the gibbs-dalton rule and the
mixing rules based on the kinetic theory of dilute gasestransport
properties for pure air were taken from the n.b.s. tabulationstransport properties for the other gases were calculated
by kinetic-theory methods, employinglennard-jones 6-12
model for the interaction potentialthe theoretical predictions
for the recovery factor along the tube with air or argon injection
agree with experimental data to within one percentthe
theoretical predictions for helium injection indicate an 8-percent
rise in the recovery factor along the tube, while experiments
have shown only1-percent risethese differences between
theory and experiment are attributed to inaccuracies in the approximations
to the transport properties of the binary mixtures .hypersonic viscous flow oversweat-cooled flat platethis paper presentstheoretical analysis of the hypersonic

ofcoolant into the external streama heat balance at
the porous surface is made between the heat transferred to the
surface and the heat absorbed by the coolantthe existence
of similar solutions requiresnonuniform distribution of coolant

the problem of minimizing the drag ofslender, two-dimensional
or axisymmetric body in hypersonic flow at zero angle of
attack is considered under the assumption that the pressure coefficient
law is newton's impact law as modified by busemann in
order to include centripetal acceleration effectsafter the condition
that the pressure coefficient be nonnegative is accounted
for and after arbitrary conditions are imposed on, in addition
to the thickness and the length, the enclosed area and the moment
of inertia of the contour in the two-dimensional case and the
wetted area and the volume in the axisymmetric case, the minimal
problem is formulated asproblem of the mayer type and
solved by the combined use of the euler-lagrange equations,
the transversality condition, the erdmann-weierstrass corner
condition, and the properties of the switching functionparticular attention is devoted to the class of problems such
that, among the four quantities being considered, two are prescribed
while the remaining are freefor these problems, the
extremal arc is composed of two subarcs ..  one is characterized bypositive pressure coefficient and is called the regular shape,. the
other is characterized byzero pressure coefficient and is called
the free layerin this connection, the analysis shows the existence
of two different types of solutions depending on whether the
thickness is given or freeif the thickness is given, the expression for the regular shape ispower law, and the transition from the regular shape to the free
layer occurs in the second half of the bodyin the two-dimensional
case, the exponent of the power law isif the length is given
if the enclosed area is given, andif the moment of inertia
of the contour is given,. the transition point from the power
body to the free layer is located at 50 percent of the length if the
length is given, at 66 percent if the enclosed area is given, and at
the axisymmetric case, the exponent of the power law is if
the length is given,if the wetted area is given, and if the
volume is given,. the transition point from the power body to the
free layer is located at 60 percent of the length if the length is
given, at 70 percent if the wetted area is given, and at 80 percent
if the volume is givenon the other hand, for problems where the thickness is free,
the equation governing the regular shape is not that ofpower
body, and the point of transition to the free layer is located in the
first half of the bodyin the two-dimensional case, the transition
point is at 28 percent of the length if the length and the enclosed
area are given, at 32 percent if the length and the moment
of inertia of the contour are given, and at 45 percent if the enclosed
area and the moment of inertia of the contour are givenin the axisymmetric case, the transition point is located at 35
percent of the length if the length and the wetted area are given,
at 39 percent if the length and the volume are given, and at 46
percent if the wetted area and the volume are givenfor all of the cases considered, analytical expressions are obtained
for the optimum shapes, the thickness ratios, and the drag
coefficients .uniformly valid second-order solution for supersonic
considered is the second-order supersonic flow overcruciform
configuration consisting of two intersecting rectangular
wings of high aspect ratiothe practical interest is in application
to supersonic inlets, wing-body junctions and vehicle finsthe fundamental interest centers about identification and adjustment
of the severe local failures of the ordinary second-order
theoryfor wings with discontinuous slopes, discontinuous
potentials occur across the planar shock and square-root singularities
in the velocities occur at the intersection of these shocks
with the cruciform surfacesthe problem is simple enough so
that these interesting features stand out clearlya second-order solution uniformly valid to first order is constructed
by adjustment of the ordinary second-order solution obtained
firstthe uniformly valid solution has two different
series representations in the thickness parameterone is the
ordinary second-order series in ascending integral powers of the
thickness parameter which is valid in the interior of the vertexcentered
undisturbed mach cone, and the other isseries containing
fractional powers which is valid adjacent to and upstream
of this mach conethe uniformly valid solution gives the detailed
wave structure and showsflow regime upstream of the
vertex-centered undisturbed mach cone not predicted by the
ordinary theorythe two solutions are otherwise identicalthe wave structure consists ofpyramidal arrangement of planar
shocks adjacent to and upstream of the above cone, followed by
weaker oblique expansion fans and finally by two extremely
weak shocks coincident with the vertex-centered undisturbed
mach coneas an example of the above, detailed results are
presented for the case of two intersecting wedgesapplication
of the techniques to other quasi-cylindrical problems is discussed .the propagation ofnonuniform magnetohydrodynamic
an initially uniform magnetohydrodynamic shock wave of
arbitrary strength propagates throughchannel which consists of
two portions of which one has uniform cross-sectional area while
the other is of varying cross-sectional areait is assumed that
the flow in the nonuniform section in front of the shock is initiallyuniform state and no perturbations (due to the area variations)
of this flow reach the shock until the area variation is encounteredwhen the shock enters the nonuniform section, it is perturbed,
the shock strength altered and the subsequent flow is nonisentropicin addition to the perturbation due to the effect of the
area variations on the initially uniform upstream flow, there are
two further contributions--viz.,permanent perturbation
caused directly by the area changes andtransient disturbance-which
propagates with true sonic speed with respect to the flow
behind the shock, due to reflections of the permanent perturbation
at the shockexpressions for these various contributions are

as mean free path behind shock sphere shock detachment
distancein the case of nonsphere shapes, the knudsen
number is defined as the knudsen number ofsphere with the
same base diameterthese drag coefficients cover the range of gasdynamics to free
molecule flow and are given in graphical formthe drag coefficients
were measured by means ofballistic balance in millisecond
intervals, and referenced to the drag coefficient ofsphere in the gasdynamics region, forgamma of 1.4, of 0.92tunnel stagnation conditions of pressure, temperature, density,
and pressure drop with time were measured directlyin the
tunnel test section, velocity,density, total pressure, and static
pressure were measured directlythese experimental curves have been found useful in the analysis
of complex shapes if the complex shapes can be easily broken
down into simple components with small interactions between
componentsheat-transfer distributions have also been obtained on these
and other complex shapes in the hypervelocity wind tunnel, by
means ofspecial paint which changes through several visible
spectral orders withinheat transfer range of x10 forsingle
applicationheat transfer rates, so obtained, have been performed
in the hypersonic gasdynamic and slip flow regions and
are presented for spheresthese data, in the vorticity interaction
region, agree with the data of ferri and zakkay .effects of cooling on boundary layer transition on
an experimental investigation of the effects of cooling on
boundary-layer transition on9-in. diameter hemisphere in
simulated hypersonic flow is reportedthe newtonian pressure
distribution was obtained by use ofshroud and boundary layer
cooling was achieved by internally cooling the modeltransition
was detected with hot wires and withpitot tube at the surfaceattainedtransition was observed in the subsonic and near-sonic flow
region at and upstream of= 45in this region the stagnation
reynolds number at which transition occurred when the surface
was highly polished was only slightly affected by cooling within
the temperature rangethus, transition reversal
does not occur onpolished spherical surface within the
range of these tests, and we therefore conclude that the cooling
did not cause the linear stability of boundary layer to decrease
significantlyan essential feature of transition studies with boundary-layer
cooling is the close control of surface roughnessin the present
experiments this control required, in addition tohighly polished
surface, the necessity for low water vapor dewpoint, the avoidance
of carbon dioxide condensation and the utilzation of every
available means for removing the dust from the airstream .magnetohydrodynamic mach conesfeatures of the surfaces of main disturbance created bysmall
object in steady motion throughconducting fluid are examinedthese surfaces are found by drawing tangent cones from the
object to the relevant wave-front diagramsthe outer wave
cone (when present) is smooth, but the two inner cones have
cross sections similar to the cusped figures of the inner wavefront
diagramit is conjectured that the disturbance may be
concentrated along such line cuspsthis has particular relevance
in the application of known two-dimensional results to
three-dimensional problems, say in the well-known techniques
of aerodynamicsin mhd the omission of the large disturbance
characteristics implicit intwo-dimensional solution may invalidate
its use in any practical three-dimensional problem .supersonic airfoil performance with small heat additionan analytical method is presented which permitsvery rapid
evaluation of the acrodynamic effects arising from the addition
of small amounts of heat near supersonic two-dimensional airfoilsthis method applies to shockless inviscid flow without heat
conductionalso, the mechanism by which the sesired heat
addition is achieved is not consideredit is shown that even small amounts of heat generatesubstantial
pressure rise and thus cause appreciable changes in the
acrodynamic coefficientsthe results of this analysis compare
favorably with those obtained bymore accurate, but also more
tedious, graphical method of characteristicstwo possible modes of application to an airplane design are
considered from the energy requirements standpointin this
connection, it is shown that the decrease of the required wing
area resulting from heat addition may, in some cases, lead to
savings in the rate of the fuel consumptionin general, however,
one should not expect any substantial reduction in energy requirements
resulting from the application of the wing heat addition
.a linearized analysis of the forces exerted onrigid
solutions are obtained in closed form for the pressures exerted
onrigid half plane by an incident, plane acoustic shock wavethe angle of incidence of the wave front is arbitrary and the half
plane is considered to be traveling at constant velocity, subsonic
of supersonic with respect to the acoustic mediuma closedform
solution is obtained also forrigid wedge which is motionless
with respect to the acoustic mediumthe analysis is carried
out by transforming the wave equation to laplace's equation
by the busemann conical transformation and then applying conformal
mapping .aerodynamic processes in the downwash-impingement problemtheoretical and experimental data relating to the downwash
impingement problem are examined in order to arrive atcoherent
understanding of the process of entrainment of ground
particles in the flowit is demonstrated thatkey mechanism
in the process is the interaction of nonuniform flow in the ground
boundary layer with bluff ground particlesthis interaction
produceslift force which, under typical conditions, equals or
exceeds the particle weightin the interest of quantitative prediction of the conditions
necessary for particle entrainment, four subsidiary problem areas
in the impinging jet are examinedthese are the viscous decay,
the inviscid flow field, the ground boundary layer, and the forces
onbluff body in nonuniform flowapplicable theories are
used in conjunction with experimental data to assess the accuracy
and range of validity of the theories, and to define the stream
conditions which will cause particle entrainmentavailable data are applied to the establishment of criteria for
particle entrainment in the vicinity of the impinging-jet stagnation
pointthese criteria show that entrainment occurs infinite annular region on the ground plane, and that the particles
most readily entrained are those withdiameter equal to about
two-thirds the thickness of the ground boundary layerthe
configuration size is shown to influence the process in that the
onset of entrainment is fixed by the jet diameter and velocity,
and the size of the ground particlesthe criteria established
providequantitative estimate of the conditions causing entrainment
and providebasis for scaling experimental results tovariety of full-scale situations .on slender airfoil theory for nonequilibrium flowan exact linear theory for nonequilibrium flow pastthin airfoil
is givengreen's function technique is used to solve the
boundary value problem for the governing third order equationupon satisfying the boundary condition on the airfoil surface an
integral equation is obtained which has an exact solutionthe
final expression for the velocity potential, given as an integral over
the source strength times the green's function, shows that the
solution is dependent not only on the slope variation of the airfoil
but also on its curvature variationthis turns out to be the case
for all free-stream mach numbersas an example, the supersonic flow pastwedge is considered .boundary layer transition at supersonic speedsthree-dimensional
further experiments carried out in the 12-in. supersonic wind
tunnel of the jet propulsion laboratory of the california institute
of technology to investigate the effect of three-dimensional
roughness elements (spheres) on boundary-layer transition onthe local mach number for these tests was 2.71the data show
clearly that the minimum (effective) size of trip required to bring
transition to its lowest reynolds number varies as the one-fourth
power of the distance from the apex of the cone to the tripuse
of available data for other mach numbers indicates that the
mach-number influence for effective tripping is taken into account
by the simple expressionsome remarks concerning the roughness variation
for transition onblunt body are made .effect of uniformly distributed roughness on turbulent
an experimental program was carried out in the 18-in. by 20in.
supersonic wind tunnel of the jet propulsion laboratory to
determine the effect of uniformly distributed sand-grain roughness
on the skin-friction drag ofbody of revolution for the case
ofturbulent boundary layerthe mach number range covered
was 1.98 to 4.54, and the reynolds number varied from
aboutx 10 tox 10some data were also obtained atmach number of 0.70at speeds up tomach number ofand for roughness sizes
such that the quadratic resistance law holds, the compressibility
effect is indirect, and the skin-friction drag isfunction of only
the roughness reynolds number, exactly as in the incompressible
caseit is shown that the entire compressibility effect
isreduction of the fluid density at the surface as the mach
number increasesthe critical roughness, below which the
surface is hydraulically smooth, is,. this is equal
to the thickness of the laminar sublayer forsmooth surface for
both compressible and incompressible flowover the range of
roughness sizes considered here, there appears to be no wave drag
associated with the drag due to roughnessthe shift in the turbulent
veocity profile forrough surface at supersonic
speeds isfunction of only the roughness reynolds number
and quantitatively follows exactly the same law as that
for the incompressible case .heat transfer to slender cones in hypersonic flow,
as part ofgeneral study of the aerothermodynamic characteristics
of flight of hypersonic vehicles, an investigation of laminar
heat transfer to slender yawed cones has been conductedexperiments have been made in the cal 11- by 15-in. shock
tunnel at mach numbers from 11 to 13 and at yaw angles up to
were testedthe heat-transfer rates are compared with theoretical predictionsthe effects on the local heat-transfer rates of the boundary-layer
displacement thickness, transverse curvature, yaw,
nose bluntness, and the entropy sublayer are discussedit is
shown that, at zero yaw, the experimental data for the sharp
cone are in good agreement with theory when boundary-layer
displacement and transverse-curvature effects are includedfor the yawed sharp cone, the heat-transfer rates along the
most windward streamline are in good agreement with reshotko's
theory for yaw angles up to.  at larger yaw angles, the experimental
heat transfer was found to be greater than that predicted
theoreticallyhowever, at these yaw angles the heattransfer
distribution on the windward side was in good agreement
with laminar-boundary-layer calculations based on an
assumption of local similaritythe zero-yaw tests of the blunted
cones showed qualitative agreement with cheng's shock-layer
theory for slender blunt-nose bodies .the drag of elongated bodies overwide reynolds number
the resistance of bodies in motion through an incompressible
viscous fluid is predictable from stokes- or oseen-type solutions
in the creeping-motion range, while some test information is
available in the boundary-layer rangewith the exception of
experimental results for spheres or circular cylinders and analytical
and experimental results for flat plates, almost no information
is available on other bodies, particularly in the intermediate
range of reynolds numbers extending from unity tomillionexperimental results as obtained from hydroballistic studies
in water and glycerin-water solutions are presented for finned
ellipsoids of fineness-ratio .4 over20,000-fold range and are
correlated with available information on other bodiesalthough
results do not extend down to the creeping-motion region where
analytical predictions are available, comparison with the drag
coefficient trends for spheres and flat plates indicates that an appropriate
curve for the ellipsoid could be extended so as to cover
the entire laminar-viscous rangeless extensive results are presented
on the drag of fineness-ratioellipsoids and on laminarturbulent
transition occurrences .the effect of slip particularly for highly cooled wallsit is found that for boundary conditions on the velocity slip
and on the temperature jump which are not oversimplified in an
unrealistic way, the effect of these phenomena on the heat transfer
and the shear atstagnation point is of the order of the ratio of
the mean free path outside the boundary layer to the boundarylayer
thickness, even for highly cooled wallsa simplified
theory of this effect is given, which puts the physical reasons for
the results in evidence and agrees closely with the more accurate
calculationsit is concluded that the effects of slip and jump
are not negligible in comparison with other low-reynolds-number
corrections, even for very cold walls .pressure distribution in regions of step-induced turbulent
an analysis is made of the pressure distribution in the separated-flow
region ahead ofstep, using the concept of the turbulent
mixing coefficient of crocco and lees and the /jet-flow/
model of chapman with some modificationon the basis ofvariable mixing coefficient,differential equation for the pressure
distribution is derived, which gives the pressure rise asfunction of the distance from the separation pointthis equation
contains the separation length as an unknowna second
equation is obtained by makingmass balance of the air entering
and, leaving the /dead-air/ region ahead of the stepthe
pressure rise and the separation distance forgiven mach number
are determined by solving the two equations simultaneouslythe analysis yields results which are in close agreement with
the experimental data on steps, obtained at princeton, particularly
for= 3.85for lower mach numbers,maximum variation
ofpercent is found between theory and experimentuse of the velocity profiles of jets, as required by the jet-flow
model, necessarily restricts the applicability of the present study
to flows with thin boundary layers at the separation point .application of inequality constraints to variational
inequality constraints are introduced into the variational
formulation of the optimum re-entry problem forlifting vehicle
to prevent human and or structural tolerances from being
exceededthese constraints consist of minimum and maximum
angle of attack, maximum load factor, and maximum convective
heat transfer (equilibrium temperature)the equations have been programed for the ibm 704 computer,
and sample trajectories are presented for which the total
heat transferred to certain critical areas on the windward surface
of the vehicle is minimizedthese trajectories indicate the
dominant effect of the constraints on the optimum flight path,
which is shown to consist of both unconstrained and constrained
arcs .experimental lift and drag ofseries of glide configurationsseries of semiballistic-type bodies consisting of three half
sphere cones of 0.3 bluntness ratio with half-cone angles of 8.6,
laboratory hypersonic shock tunnel at= 17.5 and 12.4in addition,representative winged glide configuration consisting
ofsharp-edged, 60 swept delta wing with cone-segment
the range of angle of attack for the half sphere-cone tests wasthe technique for force coefficient determination consists of
analyzing high-speed motion pictures of the motion of very light
balsa and isofoam plastic models which are literally free-flown
for several milliseconds in the test section of the shock tunnelbecause of viscous effects the newtonian prediction of half
sphere cone drag is consistently less than, but generally parallel
these bodies is generally well predicted by the newtonian theory
except at small and moderate positive angles of attack where it is
generally less than newtonianthis lift deficiency appears to
increase with cone half anglemaximum lift-drag ratios fall
considerably short of the newtonian predictionsseveral exploratory
tests at mach 11.7 and low reynolds number (approximately
reduction in) on the 13 model produced an
approximate doubling of minimum drag and35 percent decrease
in (l d) max,. this demonstrates the importance of viscous
effects for blunt bodies in the reynolds number range of these
teststhe sharp leading-edge, 60 sweep delta wing-body configuration
exhibited the same (l d) max, as the wing alone, about 2.80
at both positive and negative angles of attack .determination of lift or drag programs to minimizestudy of single-pass re-entry from escape speed and from
circular satellite speed is made to determine the lift program forhypersonic glider and the drag-modulation program fornonlifting
vehicle that minimize the heating of the vehicles within
acceleration or range constraintsa new method of numerical
solution is used, similar to kelley's /method of gradients,/ that
permits rapid convergence to the optimum lift program starting
with an original good estimatethis method avoids the twopoint
boundary-value problem of the calculus-of-variations
formulation, and is applicable to any optimum-programing
probleman acceleration-tolerance limit is introduced which
describes the human pilot's capability to withstand acceleration
more accurately thansimple acceleration limit .boundary layer transition in the presence of streamwise
results of an experimental investigation of instability leading
to transition in the subsonic boundary layer flow alongflat
plate are presenteda series of wings was placed outside the
boundary layer to produce streamwise vortices, which in turn
made the boundary layer three-dimensional--i.e., periodic in
thickness in the spanwise directionhot-wire measurements
were made to trace the downstream development of the disturbance
or wave created by the vibrating ribbonas the wave
travels downstream, it is deformed intothree-dimensional configuration
by the three-dimensionality of the boundary-layer
flow, but it is eventually damped out so long as it remains small in
intensityit is only after the wave intensity exceedscertain
amount (which depends on the degree of boundary-layer threedimensionality)
that the nonlinear effect manifests itself by the
rapid amplification of wave intensity, the rapid increase in wave
three-dimensionality, and the distortion in mean velocity profilethe appearance of nonlinear development inevitably leads to the
breakdown of laminar flow, and hence the onset of turbulencethere is presentmechanism by which the energy is transferred
from one spanwise position to another so that the breakdown of
laminar flow occurs asconsequence of three-dimensional development
of the wave aswhole .steady flow of conducting fluids in channels under
an approximate method of solution based onminimum principle
is presented for the steady laminar incompressible flow of an
electrically conducting fluid throughstraight channel of arbitrary
cross section with conducting or nonconducting walls in the
presence ofuniform transverse magnetic fieldthe hall effect
is taken into account by making simplifying assumptions that the
gas is fully ionized and that both reynolds number and magnetic
reynolds number are smallnumerical calculations are carried
out for the case ofrectangular channel .axisymmetric magnetohydrodynamic channel flowthe axisymmetric subsonic and supersonic flow fields, and the
skin friction and heat transfer of an electrically conducting compressible
fluid flowing inchannel of constant circular area
throughmagnetic field are investigated when the magnetic
reynolds number is smallthe inviscid-flow field for flow
throughdipole field is solved by the method of characteristics
in the supersonic casefor the subsonic case, linearized equations
are derived for small values of the magnetic interaction
parameternumerical results are obtained by the relaxation
methodthe inviscid-flow-field solutions are used as boundary conditions
for the laminar boundary layer along the wall, in which
axial pressure gradients form an important featurethe exact
continuum-flow equations are reduced by an order-of-magnitude
analysis to the boundary-layer equations, which are solved numerically
by an integral method usingfourth-degree velocity
profile andfifth-degree stagnation-enthalpy profilepressure, temperature, and heat-transfer measurements are
made withshock tube under supersonic-flow conditions closely
approaching those used in the numerical computationsgeneral
agreement is found between the theoretical and the experimental
results .inviscid-incompressible-flow theory of static two-dimensional
the inviscid-incompressible-flow theory of static two-dimensional
solid jets impinging orthogonally on the ground is presented
using conformal mapping methodsit is shown that the thrust ofsolid jet at constant power
initially decreases as the ground is approachedthe magnitude
of the thrust out of ground effect is regained only atvery
low height-to-jet width ratio (approximately 0.55)the maximuin
decrease is aboutpercentthe ground effect on solid
jets is thus largely unfavorable .on the plk method and the supersonic blunt-body problemdetailed analysis of the subsonic and transonic portious of the
flow field about either very blunt or asymmetric configurations
requires successive approximations,. these can be carried out insystematic fashion only when an appropriate convergent perturbation
procedure is availablethe problem of producing
successively refined sets of initial conditions for either /direct/
or /inverse/ analysis of the flow is formulated in the following
terms ..  given reasonable estimates for shock shape and pressure
distribution on the body, can one determine the flow field
of interest to any desired degree of approximation byperturbation
approach .qmprocedure to this effect is developed which involves stretching
of coordinates in the spirit of the poincare-lighthill-kuo
are transformed along body, shock, and intermediate lines so as
to annul perturbations of the local resultant velocity,. (b) for the
integral method the coordinate along the boundary of each strip
is shifted so as to control perturbations of the velocity component
that determines the critical pointthe approach is justified bystudy of the equations governing
the direct method, and by consideration of model transonic flow
problems for which closed form solutions are availablethe
range of validity of the proposed procedure is assessed by practical
application and comparison with experiment,. results are
presented fordisk set normal tolow-termperature air stream
at= 4.76, and forhighly asymmetric two-dimensional
configuration at=.the effect of adverse pressure gradients on the characteristics of
tests were conducted at mach numbers from 2.0 to 3.5 to determine
the thickness and profile shape characteristics of turbulent boundary
layers on two-dimensional and axisymmetric curved-surface models
having adverse pressure gradientsthe magnitude of the gradients
relative to the boundary-layer thickness at the beginning of the
gradient was varied by employing models having different radii of
curvature and by changing the boundary-layer thickness at the beginning
of the gradientthe overall pressure rise in most cases was
greater than the value which would causeturbulent boundary layer
to separate if the pressure rise were created by an oblique shock wavean analytical investigation was also conducted so that the results of
the experimental investigation could be applied to the prediction of
cases outside the range of the experimentsit is shown that boundary-layer momentum thickness can be predicted
from the von karman boundary-layer momentum equation, but that measured
values of boundary-layer profile shape are in poor agreement with
values computed from procedures derived by extending conventional
methods for predicting profile shape in subsonic flowa new procedure
for calculating boundary-layer profile shapes, developed in this
paper, is shown to providegood correlation between experimental
and calculated values of boundary-layer profile shapes in adverse
pressure gradients created by curved surfacesthis procedure is based
on the experimental observation that the station at which high-energy
free-stream flow actually mixes intoturbulent boundary layer in
an adverse pressure gradient is well downstream of the station at
which flow would have to mix in order to maintainflat-plate profile .heat transfer in the laminar boundary layer with ablation
the reduction of heat transfer in the laminar boundary layer
under the condition of vaporizing ablation is analyzed for arbitrary
molecular weight of the vaporprimary assumptions are
that the pressure gradient is zero, the individual components of
the binary system are perfect gases, the prandtl number is constant,
and the viscosity is proportional to temperaturevariations
through the boundary layer of the schmidt number for
binary diffusion and the density-viscosity product, are included
in the analysisthe wall temperature is held constantnumerical results are obtained for prandtl numbers of 0.75 and
varying from 0.25 to 4.00, wall concentration of the foreign gas
as high as 0.9 (corresponding to the high heat rates encountered
during re-entry), and ratio of specific heats of foreign gas equal
to that of airkinetic theory is used to obtain schmidt number
asfunction of molecular weight and concentrationthe departure of schmidt number and prandtl number from
unity and the variation of reynolds analogy factor with prandtl
number, blowing parameter, wall concentration, and molecular
weight ratio are found to have relatively minor influence on the
heat block ratio at high rates of ablationthe primary factor
governing the influence of molecular weight ratio on the heat
block ratio is the variation of across the boundary layerlittle loss of accuracy is incurred, in the range of molecular weight
ratios considered here, by assuming schmidt and prandtl numbers
of unity as long as the variation is properly taken into account .pressure-gradient effects on the preston tube in supersonic
this paper is concerned with an experimental investigation of
the effects oflongitudinal pressure gradient insupersonic
stream of air overbounding surface on the performance ofpreston or impact-pressure tube at the surfaceevidence is presented
which indicates that for the mach number considered and
for the range of pressure gradients covered, the preston tube functions
incompletely satisfactory manner for the determination
of local shear stress .leading-edge separation of laminar boundary layersbrief description of the flow field is given for the interaction
of shock wave and laminar boundary layer oncompression
corner in supersonic flowa special sub-case--that of leadingedge
laminar separation--is analyzed by extension of chapman's
laminar mixing-layer theoryresults are tabulated for ranges
of mach number, and compression-corner anglea limited region of possible leading-edge laminar
separation with an attached leading-edge shock (or in certain
cases an expansion) followed bysecond shock due to the reattachment
flow is found to existcomparison with existing
experimental data is found to be satisfactory in several cases .the effect of sweep angle on hypersonic flow over bluntseries of tests were carried out in the princeton university
helium hypersoule wind tunnel on blunt two-dimensional wings
at zero angle of attack with sweep angles up to 70 at mach
numbers fromto 15the leading edge reynolds number varied
from 3,000 to 25,000the measured pressure distributions were
compared with the simple summation of the theoretical inviscid
effect (based on blast wave theory using the normal mach
number) added to the viscous effect (calculated as if no sweep
were present)for the unswept wing, the slope of the pressure
decay was reasonably well predicted by the theoretical calculationsthe viscous theory reasonably predicted the variation in
the pressure distribution due to changes in leading-edge reynolds
numberby subtracting the theoretical viscous effects, an
inviscid mach number dependence of the 2.2 power was found
as compared to the value of 2.0 predicted by the inviscid theorythe same approach for the swept wing did not give consistently
satisfactory resultsdeviations avove and below the calculated
value by as much as 40-50 percent were measured and there
seemed to be no systematic variation with either mach number or
reynolds numberatconstant high reynolds number, it was
found that the pressure distribution varied with the distance
along the wing with an exponent between about--0.53 and--0.58
except forrather sharp decrease which occurred for the 70
sweep casethe pressure atgiven station forfixed mach
number and given leading edge thickness varied as the cosine of
the sweep angle to the 1.1 power as compared to the 1.3 power
predicted from general geometrical considerations .hypersonic nozzle expansion of air with atom recombination
an experimental investigation on the expansion of high-temperature,
high-pressure air to hypersonic flow mach numbers inconical nozzle ofhypersonic shock tunnel has been carried outthe equilibrium temperature and pressure ranges after the reflected
shock wave were 1400 to 6000and 100 to 1000 psiastatic-pressure measurements, which are sensitive to the state
of the gas, were made along the axis of the nozzle for different
reservoir conditionsthese results are compared with the calculated
equilibrium and /frozen/ data for the same geometry
and initial reservoir conditionsfor reservoir pressures greater than 500 psia, the expansion of
the air in the nozzle is essentially in equilibrium up to reservoir
temperatures of about 4,500.  for temperatures greater than
almost frozenatgiven area ratio for the nozzle and reservoir
pressure, the expansion process remains in equilibrium up tocertain reservoir temperature, and beyond this temperature the
flow expansion deviates rapidly from the equilibrium process and
approaches the frozen case .hypersonic flow over an elliptic cone: theory and experimentby applying hypersonic approximations to ferri's linearized
characteristics method, simple results were obtained for the
shock shape and surface pressure distribution for an unyawed
conical body of arbitrary cross sectioncalculations were
carried out for an elliptic cone havingratio of major to minor
axes of, andsemivertex angle of about 12 in the meridian
plane containing the major axisan experimental investigation
of the flow over this body conducted atmach number of 5.8
in the galcit hypersonic wind tunnel showed that the surface
pressure distribution at zero angle of attack agreed quite closely
with the theoretical predictionon the other hand, the simple
newtonian approximation predicts pressures that are too lowsurface pressure distributions and schlieren photographs of
the shock shape were obtained at angles of attack up to 14 at
zero yaw, and at angles of yaw up to 10 at zero pitchat the
higher angles of attack the newtonian approximation for the
surface pressures is quite accurate .the curtain jeta detailed analytic study is made of the curtain jet, the twodimensional
fluid wall used to contain support pressure on the
underside of ground effect machinestwo variations of the jet
are studied in detail--the bifurcated jet, in whichportion of the
flow streams into the support pressure region, and the deflected
jet, in which none of the flow penetrates into the support pressure
regionkirchhoff-helmholtz free steamline analysis is used
to construct the flow field, and quantitative results are presented
for the effect of nozzle inclination and detailed geometry on flow
requirements and support pressure differential at varying
altitudes .supersonic shear flow past an airfoil between two parallel

the span direction paststraight wing between two parallel
walls is studied using the small-disturbance theorythe governing
equation for the disturbance pressure on the airfoil, together
with the boundary conditions on the airfoil and at the walls, is
solved by the method of separation of variablesupon separation

problem and to the solution of the telegraph equationas an application,certain mach number profile is selected
and the resulting pressure distribution onparabolic arc airfoil
is computed .direct calculation of pressure distribution on blunt

spherical segments and flat-headed cylindersresults on
spheres are also includedin the present paper belotserkovskii's

pressure distribution and shock shape with experimental results
shows very good agreement .a theory of the two dimensional laminar bounary layer
the purpose of this paper is to presenttheory to account for
surface curvature effects on the two-dimensional boundary-layer
flow which approachespotential flow at free streamthe problem of two-dimensional viscous flow is first formulated
by using the streamlines and their orthogonal trajectories as the
generalized coordinatesa boundary-layer approximation is
applied to the navier-stokes equations and the gauss equation
in the generalized coordinates to yield the boundary-layer equationsthe conditions under which similar solutions of the
boundary-layer equations exist are determinedbysimple
transformation, the governing differential equation can be expressed
inform which reduces to the falkner-skan equation
for zero surface curvaturenumerical results forsimilar solution which corresponds toflow overcurved surface with zero surface pressure gradient
have been obtainedthe velocity profiles in the boundary layer
and the wall skin-friction distribution for concave and convex
surfaces are presentedthe wall skin friction forconvex wall
is found to be higher than the blasius value forflat plateon
the other hand, forconcave wall, the skin friction will drop below
the blasius value as the curvature increases, but it appears to
reachminimum, and beyond this minimum point it will increase
againthe same flow problem was treated by murphy bydifferent method of analysiscomparison of murphy's results
with those obtained by the present method reveals some basic
differences in the boundary-layer characteristicsin particular,
murphy's results indicate that the wall skin friction forconvex
surface is smaller than the blasius value, while forconcave wall
it is higher .the stagnation point boundary layer in the presence
similarity equations for axisymmetric compressible flow are obtained,
assuming that the magnetic field is uniform, normal to the
surface, and unaffected by the flow, and that the conductivity varies
as the nth power of the enthalpynumerical solutions are
given fornumber of values ofand of the field strength, and are
used to modify the estimates of heat-transfer made by the author
using inviscid theory (title source 26, 536-537, 1959) .foreign-gas injection intocompressible turbulent
the distributed injection offoreign gas intocompressible,
turbulent boundary layer in the absence ofpressure gradient is
consideredthe analysis is performed within the framework of
the binary-mixture concept, that is, the primary fluid flowing
over the surface represents one component while the injected
species represents the secondcalculations have been performed for the injection of helium
into undissociated airthe results indicate an effect of mach
number on surface shear and energy transfer when distributed
light-gas injection normal to the surface existsa comparison
with experimental data indicates reasonable agreement overrange of mach numbers .the newtonian approximation in magnetic hypersonic
the hypersonic flow of an electrically conducting fluid around
the stagnation region ofsphere carryingradial magnetic field
is examinedby assumingnewtonian pressure distribution and constant
density, the differential equation of the inviscid flow is integrated
andsimple closed-form solution is obtainedit is found that the ratio of the stand-off distances of the shock
wave for the magnetic and nonmagnetic cases does not depend explicitly
on the magnetic parameter(ratio of the ponderomotive
force to the free-stream inertia force) nor on the density ratio (the
value at the free stream divided by the value behind the shock
wave) but on the productat least for values of between
andthe velocity gradient on the body is also calculated and the
ratio of the magnetic to the nonmagnetic case is shown to depend
on the parameterthe case of cylindrical shocks is also examined,. the same
general conclusions are drawn .body under lifting wingan investigation is made of supersonic-aircraft configurations
composed ofcambered body positionedcertain distance
beneath an arbitrary lifting wingthe geometry of the wing is
regarded as given and the geometry of the body may be given or
optimumexpressions for the drag and lift are obtained from
reverse-flow considerations,. these greatly implement suchstudy when interference cross flows must be cancelledthe
drag advantage to be gained whengiven body and wing assumegiven orientation is studiedtreated more extensively
is the variational problem of determining the optimum wing
incidence and optimum body shape, for the given volume and
length, to yield the minimum drag for prescribed liftnumerical
results are provided to indicate the significance of the large
number of parameters appearing in the problemof these, the
gap between the wing and the body is found to be particularly
importantit is found that at low gap moderate body distortions
havesignificant influence on the dragdrag reductions
of up to 44 relative to the case of no interference have been
found atmach number of 2.24 inconfiguration havinggap approximately equal to the maximum diameter of the body,
andwing chord of about three eighths of the length of the bodycomparison is made with the conventional wing-body combination
including the effects of skin friction, and it is concluded that
the advantage suggested by the preceding considerations is not
appreciably diminishedfinally, it is shown that the configurations
studied lead to bodies of fineness ratios much lower
than are appropriate to conventional wing-body combinationstests were made on an arrangement consisting ofscarshaack
body located underlifting rectangular diamond-profile
wingthe mach number was 1.6 and the reynolds number
was 9.1710 based on the body lengthit was found that the
measured lift developed on the wing due to the flow field of the
body agrees very well with the theoretical valuedownstream
of the impinging shock from the wing, flow separation was observed
on the exterior of the body but not in the interiorthe
separation is attributed not to the pressure rise across the shock
but to the pressure field arising from the reflection from the
body of the shock-induced cross flowfurther observations
suggest that the separation can be avoided by pitching the body
or by kinking the body at the shock wave to accommodate the
shock-induced cross flow .nonsimilar solutions of the compressible laminar boundarynew method is presented for predicting the boundary-layer
characteristics downstream of the porous region of an injectioncooled
surfacethe method consists ofgeneral scheme for
obtaining nonsimilar solutions of the compressible-laminarboundary-layer
equations and is formulated along the following
linesthe viscous domain is divided intocurvilinear stripsthe governing equations are then integrated along the coordinate
normal to the body from the surface to the boundary of each
stripasresult, one obtainsset of independent integrodifferential
relationsthe integration is carried out by expressing
the integrands as polynomials, the coefficients of which
are functions of the unknown values of the velocity and temperature
on the strip boundaries as well as of the imposed boundary
condition at the wall and at the outer edgeafter the
integration is performed,set of ordinary first-order differential
equations is obtainedthe set of equations may be solved for
given initial conditions bynumerical integration scheme such
as the runge-kutta methodseveral numerical examples of
interest are presented .the turbulent boundary layer on chemically active ablating
incompressible turbulent-boundary-layer analysis is extrapolated
analytically to the case ofcompressible turbulent
boundary layer with ablation or mass injection at the surfacethe effects of chemical reactions such as dissociation and recombination
as well as combustion are includedthe analysis
applies to blunt as well as sharp bodies which are either axisymmetric
or two-dimensionalwhen the turbulent lewis and
prandtl numbers are unity, it is found that, as in the laminar
case, little detailed knowledge of the chemistry inside the boundary
layer is required in most instancesthe conditions at the
surface and the outer edge of the boundary layer are often sufficient
for prediction of heat and mass transfercomparison is made with experiments on the combustion of
graphite under turbulent flow conditionsprediction of ablation
rates within about 30 percent accuracy is obtained when empirical
constants obtained from incompressible velocity profiles
with no mass injection are used .some considerations on the laminar stability of time-dependent basic
asstability criterion for infinitesimal disturbances in an
incompressible, parallel but time-dependent basic flow, it is proposed
to introduce the concept of /momentary stability,/ which is said
to prevail at the instant if the kinetic energy of the disturbances,
asfraction of the kinetic energy of the basic flow, tends to decreasethe significance of suchcriterion is briefly discussedfor special time-dependent basic flows which are described by similar
velocity profiles at all times (except for changes in amplitude),
in the inviscid limit onlychange of the time scale is needed to
reduce the solution essentially to that for the steady casethe disturbances
may be of either the transverse-wave or the longitudinalvortices
typethe result indicatesvery strong destabilizing
influence of deceleration, which is likely to overshadow that of the velocity
profile under normal circumstancesthe observations of fales
rotating cylinders) are believed to be largely due to the decelerationat finite reynolds numbers, the usual procedure of calculating the
stability solution on the basis of the instantaneous profile is further
shown to be valid only for extremely slow acceleration or decelerationeven when the solution is acceptable, the condition for neutral
stability may not be used without reservationto calculate
momentary stability properly,procedure forslowly varying but more
general profile is also described .supersonic boom of wing-body configurationsthe supersonic boom in steady, level flight ofwing-body
configuration is due to the effects of body volume, wing volume,
wing incidence or lift, and wing-body interferencethe contribution
in the far field of each of these factors can, in any given
azimuthal plane, be represented as that of an equivalent body
of revolutionthis concept is developed to investigate the
possibilities of using interference among the components ofwing-body configuration to reduce or suppress the boom due to
liftresults of wind tunnel experiments are also presented and
discussed in light of the theoretical indications .on the aerodynamic noise ofturbulent jeta new model is advanced for analyzing the broad-spectrum
noise ofturbulent jetthe shear layer bounding the turbulent
jet is assumed to play an important role in modifying the /quadrupole
sound radiation/ from the interiorto the sound-emitting
small-scale turbulent eddies (with frequencies much higher
than those of large-scale eddies), the laminar shear layer has an
irregular contour, as if the large-scale turbulent motions were
frozenthe linearized analysis is then applied to the laminar
shear layer to relate the acoustic oscillations across itthe concept of geometrical acoustics is generalized to represent
the passage of an acoustic ray throughlaminar shear layeracoustic rays may be traced across the shear layer as transmission
and refraction, but they may also be apparently /absorbed/
or /generated/ by the laminar layerthis /generation/ is visualized
as the schematic representation, within the framework of
geometrical acoustics, of the action of the reynolds stress in
transferring energy from the shearing mean flow to the acoustic
wavessuch action of the reynolds stress can be neglected in
ordinary acoustics when the acoustic medium is not moving at
speeds comparable to the speed of sound in the mediumhowever,
this action is of crucial importance in the aerodynamic noise
of high-speed turbulent jets where the reynolds stress is the fundamental
element of the radiating quadrupoles, according to
lighthillthose acoustic waves that become /stationary/ with respect
to the local mean flow somewhere in the interior of the shear layer
are significantly modified by the viscous action through the
critical layerthe shear layer therefore serves asselective
amplifier of the acoustic waves passing through itkinematically,
the shear layer brings about the preferred downstream
emission ..  dynamically, the shear-layer augmentation significantly
increases the polar peak noise levelthe acoustic power
output per unit solid angle for such downstream emissions augmented
by the shear layer (including the polar peak) varies as,
predicted by lighthill, but without lighthill's convective
correctionson the other hand, the acoustic power output per
unit solid angle nearly normal to the jet, due to the transmitted
downstream-propagating waves, varies roughly asheating
the jet gas increases the shear-layer augmentation and may increase
the polar peak noise level by several dbthe silencing
action of the edge notches and edge teeth may also be interpreted
as due apparently to the result of possible distortion of
the shear-layer profiles .some aspects of nonequilibrium flowsin this paper are discussed some of the general features of nonequilibrium
flowin particular, vibrational relaxation is discussed
in detailthis case is somewhat simpler than dissociation
and ionization but it illustrates some of the main new features of
nonequilibrium flowthose aspects of two-dimensional and
axisymmetric flow behind shock waves are examined analytically
which yield significant information without requiring numerical
solution of the governing equationsthe thermodynamics ofvibrational relaxing gas are discussedthe conditions for simulating flows are notedcrocco's
theorem and the characteristic equations are derivedthensimple method of obtaining the initial gradients of the flow variables
behindshock is shownthese gradients are used in discussing
two particular flowsan exact solution for flow overcusped body is obtainedflow overwedge near the tip and
far from the tip is consideredit is found that far from the tipboundary-layer type phenomenon occurs .solution of subsonic nonplanar lifting surface problems
the method proposed in this paper is based on an approximate
solution of the integral equation which represents the potential
flow aboutfinite wing, with no restrictions beyond those necessary
for linearizationafter assuming the usual series representation
of the wing surface vorticity distribution, the solution
is achieved by approximating portions of the kernels of the transformed
integral equation by single and double fourier series and
performing termwise integrations analyticallythis is followed
by the routine inversion of the aerodynamic influence coefficient
matrix, after satisfying appropriate boundary conditions at
selected control pointsin this procedure the number of control
point used is limited only by the storage capacity of the computercontrol points may be located so as to cover the entire
wing surface, with due regard to certain physical requirements,
permitting the accurate representation of complicated mean
surface shapesan evaluation of the proposed method is includedcomparisons
with other theoretical methods and electrical analogy tank
results are used to substantiate the accuracy of the proposed
method when applied to plane wingsa final evaluation involvescomparison of calculated surface pressure distribution
with wind-tunnel measurements onswept, tapered wing withcambered and twisted mean surfacethe agreement evidenced
in the latter comparison has the same order of overall accuracy as
similar comparisons on plane wing planformsin either case,
the results given by the proposed method are within the accuracy
requirements for most aircraft design studies .the supersonic boom ofprojectile related to drag
the whitham theory predicting the far-flow field aroundprojectile is used to derive body shapes which produce extreme
bow shock-wave pressure jump or /boom,/ subject to constraining
conditions regarding the drag due to the bow shock and fineness
ratio of the bodiesit is found that the minimum drag
body is also the minimum boom bodythe body-volume effect
and the effect of discontinuities in slope of the body meridian
section on the boom intensity is investigatedasgeneral result of the investigation, it can be said that the
boom ofprojectile for given mach number and flight altitude
is primarily determined by its length and fineness ratiothe
maximum variation in the boom intensity for pointed bodies
with given length and fineness ratio is of the order of 10 per centthe geometry of the bodies is thus found to playminor role .an analytic extension of the shock-expansion methodthe problem is considered of calculating approximately the
inviscid rotational flow field and pressure distribution aboutsmooth two-dimensional airfoil with sharp leading and trailing
edges inuniform supersonic or hypersonic streamthe assumption
ofperfect gas is made, and the basic flow pattern for
the analysis is taken to be given by the simple isentropic shockexpansion
method with straight characteristicsan elementary
characteristics treatment is discussed to show when the simple
shock-expansion method should be satisfactory for computing
the surface pressure distribution, and under what circumstances
it may be expected to break downby utilizing characteristic
variables the isentropic shock-expansion method is then formulated
analytically, and an analytic result is obtained for the shock
shape corresponding to this zero-order approximationin the
special case where hypersonic similitude is applicable, that is,
for slender bodies and high mach numbers, the shock-shape
expression for large distances is found to reduce to the result
previously given by mahony, which for weak shocks and slender
bodies in turn reduces to the simple-wave result first given by
friedrichsemploying the analytic form of the isentropic shock-expansion
method aszero-order approximation, an analytically consistent
perturbation method is developed by expanding the dependent
flow variables in the exact partial differential equations in powers
of the reflection coefficient for simple waves interacting with an
oblique shockthe scheme by its nature helps to define those
regions in which shock expansion can be used, in addition to
taking into account inperturbation sense the factors neglected
in simple shock-expansion theory, namely, the curvature and
reflection of the mach waves and the correct boundary conditions
at the shock waveanalytic solutions are obtained for
the first-order corrections, including the surface pressure distributionthe necessary numerical computation of the integrals
involved is considerably simpler thandirect application of the
method of characteristicsto illustrate the method and its
accuracy, the zero-order shock shape and first-order pressure distribution
are calculated forfamily of parabolic arc airfoils at
an infinite free-stream mach numberthese results are compared
with rotational characteristic solutions where available,
and the present method is found to be in excellent agreement .plasma flow overthin charged conductorthe flow ofdense plasma overwavy conducting wall of
small amplitude is investigated where magnetic effects are
negligiblethese results are then used to analyze the flow overthin conductor with cusped edgesit is found that the coulomb
drag vanishes identically, while the fluid-pressure drag
corresponds to the ackeret value forneutral particle gas at the
reduced-plasma mach number .high-speed viscous corner flowa boundary-layer integral method analysis is set up for compressible
laminar flow insymmetric corner with varying angle
and streamwise pressure gradientit represents an extension
and modification of the constant density analysis of loitsianskii
and bolshakovthe analysis is applied to the case of constant
pressure, constant corner angle, and isothermal surfaces, for
which the crocco velocity-enthalpy relation holdsalthough
simplifying assumptions limit the quantitative accuracy outside
the 60 to 120 angle range, some qualitative trends are probably
correct outside this rangethe limiting cases nearand 180 are not consideredfavorable agreement between some results obtained by the
integral method and by other methods is demonstrated for the
isothermal, constant-density caseresults show an increasingly sharp merger of the outermost
isovels of streamwise velocity as the mach number increasesthis sharp merging of the outer isovels is increased by increasing
corner angle and by insulation of heating of the surfaceswithin
the interior of the viscous layer the spreading or contraction of
the disturbed region of merging is influenced by surface heattransfer
conditionssurface shear and heat flux are decreased
in the disturbed region, and are zero at the apexfor cases
corresponding roughly to the higher mach numbers of wider
corner angles, the /specific momentum-area/ exhibits the same
decrease with mach number as its two-dimensional counterpart,
whereas the /specific displacement-area,/measure of streamtube
dilation, increases more rapidly with mach number than
the comparable two-dimensional parameter .viscous flow pastquarter infinite platea study is made of the motion of an incompressible viscous
fluid pastquarter-infinite plate, whose leading edge is perpendicular
to and whose side edge is parallel to the undisturbed
direction of the streamit is assumed that the kinematic viscosity
is smallthe first approximation is taken to be the undisturbed
motion, and successive approximations are obtained
by iferationthe second approximation is the blasius shear
layer necessary to satisfy the boundary conditions on the platein turn, this layer leads tovelocity component normal to the
plate which needspotential solution, in which the velocities
are 0, to match with the conditions at infinityfurther,
the match at the edge of the blasius shear layer must be completed
toby introducingsecondary shear layerthe
regions near the leading and side edges are considered separately,.
in particular, the neighborhood of the side edge needs special
care, because the determination of the chief terms is complicated
by the presence of powers of login particular it is shown
that the effect of the edge is to change the skin-friction coefficient
byfactoron the approach to chemical and vibrational equilibrium
the concurrent approach to chemical and vibrational equilibrium
ofpure diatomic gas passing throughstrong normal
shock wave is investigatedit is demonstrated that the equilibrium
degree of dissociation behind the shock front, and hence the
density, for the case where the vibrational degrees of freedom are
frozen out can exceed the degree of dissociation, and hence the
density, for the case where all degrees of freedom are in equilibriumthus the necessary condition formaximum of the
density between the shock front and the position of full equilibrium
flow downstream of the shock front is establishedthe
sufficient condition that suchmaximum be observable is shown
to be that the approach to equilibrium of the vibrational degrees
of freedom (or any other internal degrees of freedom) must lag
the approach to dissociation equilibrium bysignificant amount,.
that is, there must be at least an order of magnitude difference in
the respective relaxation times before suchmaximum might be
observedan example calculation formach 13 strong shock
wave in oxygen illustrates the appearance of suchmaximum of
the density and its dependency upon the relative values of the
vibration and dissociation relaxation times .hypersonic viscous flow near the stagnation point in
the present study investigates the hypersonic viscous flow
past blunt-nosed bodies with hydromagnetic interactionlocalsimilarity
solutions of flow field and temperature distribution are
near the stagnation-point regionthe discussions may be
grouped into two parts ..  the two-dimensional problem (circular
cylinder) and axisymmetric problem (sphere)numerical computations have been carried out for the sphere
problem for the /viscous-layer regime,/ with various magnetic
field strengths and electrical conductivities .combustion in the boundary layer onporous surfacethe position of the diffusion flame inboundary layer with
uniform mixture injection fromporous wall parallel touniform
air stream is determined under the conditions of laminar, steady
flow with zero streamwise pressure gradientunder the assumption
of fast forward reaction rate, solutions of the boundary
layer forms of the conservation laws of acrothermochemistry are
obtained leading toformula for the downstream velocity at
the flame in terms of composition and flow variablesthe
rates of change of conditions at the wall in the streamwise
direction are assumed to be relatively smallmethods of
treating complex reaction systems are described, and generalized
form of the reynolds analogy is developed .the flow aboutcharged body moving in the lower atmospherethe flow about an electrically charged body traveling at high
speeds through the lower ionosphere is analyzeda simple
gas model composed of electrons, ions, and neutral particles is
used and the hydrodynamic description given is based on maxwell's
transfer equations formixturethe conditions under which local statistical equilibrium can
be assumed are discussed, and different approaches to determine
the gasdynamic force in the subsonic, supersonic, and hypersonic
cases are indicatedthe reciprocal action of the electric field
of the flow on the body is also analyzed andformula for the
resultant electric force is giventhe total force on the body
is equal to the sum of the gasdynamic force and the electric forcethe negative potential acquired byplane body is also
calculatedfinally, the lack of validity of debye's linearization
in this case and the solution of the exterior nonlinear problem
which characterize the electric potential and the electron distribution
are discussed .fluctuating lift and drag acting oncylinder inthe fluctuating lift and drag acting oncircular cylinder inflow of an incompressible fluid at large reynolds numbers were
measureddata on the root-mean-square values of the lift and
drag coefficients, the extreme values of these coefficients, and
their power spectra at various reynolds numbers are presented .an optical boundary-layer probethe applicability of the schlieren-photomultiplier technique to
obtain quantitative density measurements in the laminar boundary
layer induced bytraveling shock wave inshock tube is
investigatedtests were conducted atmach number of 1.58
so that the data could be compared with the exact theoretical
solution tabulated by mirelsthe data obtained are in good
agreement with the theory if the distance of the light beam above
the floor of the shock tube is adjusted to fit the theoretical curve,.
this would not be necessary iflarger shock tube were usedvalues of the transition reynolds number were also determined
which are slightly less than those found by martin using an interferometerit is shown that this technique is sensitive enough
to detect changes in density that are only 0.000 per cent of atmospheric
density .heat transfer, recovery factor and pressure distributions
measurements of the heat transfer, recovery factor, and
pressure distributions aroundcircular cylinder normal tosupersonic rarefied-air stream (total temperature 300 k.)
are described for the mach number range of 1.3 to 5.7, the
reynolds number range of 37 to 4,100 and at cylinder wall
average temperature levels of 90 k. and 210.  study of the
results yielded ..  (1)correlation equation for the stagnationpoint
nusselt number asfunction of the reynolds number just
after the normal part of the detached bow shock wave,. and (2)
fourier series expressions for the heat-transfer coefficient and
pressure coefficient distributions in terms of the stagnation point
valuesin comparing these measurements with predictions based on
recent analytical studies, exceptionally good agreement for the
heat-transfer coefficient distribution was obtained with lees'
theoryin the mach number range of 3.55 to 5.73 the pressure
decreased less rapidly with distance from the stagnation point
than predicted by the modified newtonian theory .second-order theory for unsteady supersonic flow past
an analysis is made of the second-order effects of thickness on
the unsteady aerodynamic forces onslender pointed body of
revolution in supersonic flowthe theory is restricted to harmonic
oscillations for small angles of attackthe solution is obtained
by approximating the nonlinear terms in the second-order
potential equation by their first-order values and solving the
resulting inhomogeneous partial differential equation, subject to
more refined boundary conditionsthe pressure equation is
likewise refined and integrated to give the second-order corrections
to lift and pitching moment coefficientsthe analysis can
be considered as an extension of the second-order, slender body
theory of lighthill to the case of unsteady flowthe results indicate appreciable reductions in unsteady lift
and damping moment coefficients when applied to slender conesthe present theory is estimated to be reliable provided that
is less than 0.7 .on the response of the laminar boundary layer to small
the linearized treatment of small time-dependent disturbances
oflaminar boundary layer, initiated by lighthill, is extended in
several waysin particular, the high-frequency expansion is
continued beyond the leading (stokes) termseveral interesting
questions of /joining/ occur, which are discussed but left unresolvedin addition,practical method for obtaining the response
to the laminar boundary layer to an impulsive change in
velocity is presentedthe methods are applied to the case in
which the basic steady flow belongs to the falkner and skan
family of similarity solutions .a method of calculating velocity distribution for turbulentnew method of calculating the behavior of turbulent boundary
layers in adverse pressure distributions is developed which
permits direct determination of the velocity profile rather than
the gross integral parameters normally used to infer the general
character of the boundary layerthe method offers the simplicity
of algebraic equations coupled with the use of charts
rather than the laborious simultaneous solution of coupled differential
equations required by existing methodsthe method also
ary-layer thickness, thus allowing calculation of the absolute as
affords, for the first time,means of determining the total boundwell
as the nondimensional velocity distributionthe velocity profile is considered to be composed of two regions--an
inner region which is described by the law of the wall
and an outer region which is described byfunction depicting
the deviation from that lawthe deviation function involves
two parameters which are uniquely dependent upon the skinfriction
coefficient andthird parameter which, for practical
purposes, can be consideredconstantsince the entire velocity
distribution was found to be almost uniquely dependent
upon the local skin friction, serious doubt is cast upon the generally
accepted /history concept/ which considers the outer region
of the boundary layer to be dependent on integrated upstream
conditionsagreement between experimental velocity distributions and
those calculated by the method presented here is generally very
goodthe analysis and calculation procedures which are presented
are applicable to two-dimensional, pseudo-two-dimensional,
and axisymmetric conical flows .an extension of the linearized characteristics method
the method of linearized characteristics as applied by ferri to
the flow about elliptic cones can be used to determine the surface
pressure distribution, even when only linear terms are kept in the
boundary conditions, provided an area rule requirement is satisfiedin addition, the method can be applied for angles of attack
provided the elliptic body geometry is specified inmanner that
does not distort the cross sectionthe surface pressure distribution
obtained by this modified method is in reasonable agreement
with experiment over the range of mach numbers and
semidiameter ratios consideredexperimental results for several
conical bodies are presented .turbulent heat transfer throughhighly cooled, partially
the problem of heat transfer from high-temperature air
throughturbulent boundary layer tocold surface is considered
both analytically and experimentallyheat-transfer
data obtained in shock tubes are presented and correlated bysemiempirical theory which includes the effect of atomic diffusionthe distinguishing characteristics of turbulent boundary
layers with dissociation and large cooling are consideredit is
shown that the equations governing such flow, after certain
approximations, can be represented inform similar to the classical
equations forturbulent boundary layeran approximate theory is proposed for turbulent heat transfer
forhighly cooled boundary layer on portions of the body where
the pressure gradient is negligible in the case of blunted bodies
of revolution in high-speed flightexperimental results obtained on the cylindrical portion ofhemisphere-cylinder model are presented for conditions simulating
flight speeds to 21,350 ft. sec., where up to 30 per cent of
the molecules are dissociatedreynolds numbers of 2.510,
based on local fluid properties external to the boundary layer,
were achievedthe larger values of reynolds number and
flight speed were not obtained simultaneously, due to structural
limitations of the shock tubes,. however, the experiments were
conducted in suchway that the important effects of each could
be determinedin the experiments the mach number external to the boundary
layer varied between 1.7 and 2.2the corresponding mach
number for blunted nonslender bodies in flight would havemaximum value between 2.5 and 4,. however, it is shown that
these differences in mach number are not important for such
bodies .boundary layer transition and heat transfer in shock
an experimental study is made of the wall boundary layer inshock tube operated overwide range of shock mach numbers
and pressure levels in air, including those for which real-gas effects
existtransition distances are determined and correlated in
terms of the transition reynolds number based oncharacteristic
length for this boundary layerdata from independent
shock-tube studies are also included in this correlationthe results indicateweak dependence of transition reynolds
number on shock strength up to moderate values of shock mach
number, followed bylarger stabilizing tendencycomparison
of these data with transition data obtained in the same manner
in argon indicate that the increased cooling rates are largely
responsible for the stabilizationa dependence of transition reynolds number on the unit
reynolds number is found at the lower shock strengthsspecifically,
higher transition reynolds numbers are achieved at
larger unit reynolds numbersthe phenomenon of transition reversal does not appear within
the range of the experiments reportedlaminar- and turbulent-flow heat-transfer rates to the walls
of the shock tube are determined experimentallythe results
of the heat-transfer measurements substantiate existing theories
in both the laminar- and turbulent-flow regimes .on the thrust hypothesis for the jet flap including
this paper is concerned with the thrust generated byjet
flapit is shown that/linear/ thrust hypothesis can be obtained,
provided linearized potential flow is assumedin fact,
the linearized problem ofjet-flap system is found to be the
linear combination oflift problem andthrust problemthe
lift problem gives all the lift generated, but it is of interest to note
that the thrust problem would yield all the thrust developed by
the jet flap within the limitation of the linearized theorythe mixing of the jet flap with the surrounding fluid is analyzed
by the momentum-integral methodthe analysis substantiates
stratford's suggestion for obtaining an increase of thrust by
causing the jet to mix with the main stream inregion of high
suctionfinally, some approximate formulas, relating the thrust
and the jet angle, are derivedthe drag of the airfoil section and
other viscous effects are, however, not considered .minimum wing wave drag with volume constrainta numerical method is developed for calculating the minimum
thickness drag forgiven wing planform and volume using
linearized supersonic flow theorythe corresponding optimum
volume distribution is also determinedthe results show that
considerable drag reduction is possible by improved volume
distribution .on supersonic flow past thick airfoilsthe inviscid rotational supersonic flow behind the shock wave
attached to the sharp leading edge of an airfoil is studied bytransformation of coordinates which introduces the crocco stream
function as an independent variableusing expansions in the power series of, an iterative process
is developed for the determination of pressure distribution along
the airfoil surface .stable combustion ofhigh-velocity gas inheated
it is generally recognized that stable combustion processes in
heated boundary layers may be achieved by either of two conceptual
mechanismsin one mechanism it is pictured that the heat
transfer to the wall quenches the propagating flame atcertain
distance from the surfacethe equality between the flow velocity
and the normal burning velocity at this quenching distance determines
the position of the propagating flamein the second
mechanism it is conceived that the hot surface providescontinuous
source of ignition in much the same manner that the hot
recirculation zone ofbluff body flame holder provides continuous
ignition to the gas flowing around itin this case it is the characteristic
time during which the gas must be heated that determines
the position of the flameall experimental work reported to date has been concerned with
conditions where the first picture has apparently been applicablein the present paper, experiment and analysis are given that show
under what conditions the continuous ignition mechanism provides
the appropriate model and also how the two models are relatedto differentiate the two mechanisms an experiment was set up to
study flame stabilization in high-velocity boundary layers overwall heated in the form ofstep functionwithturbulent
boundary layer andwall temperature above 1,700f., the characteristic
time was found to besystematic and reproducible
variablethese observations led to the conclusion thatcontinuous
ignition mechanism governs stabilization in heated turbulent
boundary layersa rational explanation is made for the
transition from the low-speed mechanism known to be applicable
in unheated turbulent boundary layers and heated laminar boundary
layers to the ignition mechanism applicable in heated turbulent
boundary layersasfurther verification of the continuous ignition mechanism
an apparent ignition energy was foundthe logarithm of the heat
added at the lower stability limit was found to belinear function
of the reciprocal of the limiting wall temperaturethe activation
energy derived from this arrhenius type of relation agreed reasonably
well with the estimated value for the fuel used .a study of supersonic combustionsteady, stable, plain, and oblique detonation waves were
created inhigh-temperature, steady flow supersonic tunnelignition conditions and properties across the wave were measuredthe local-wave fluid-dynamic properties agree well
with detonation theoryexperimental data are presented in
detail and compared with other studies and theoryexperimental
behavior of these detonations and their possible utility
are discussed .supersonic inlet dynamicsan approximation of the differential equation for compressible
duct flow is presentedthe equation is linear and of the second
orderthe duct transfer function and response characteristics
are obtained by applying small-perturbation theory to the differential
equationthe resulting equations describe duct

was done in the 1010 andxft. supersonic tunnels
at nasa lewis flight propulsion laboratoryfurther agreement
was obtained during flight tests of the f8u-3 airplane .theory of supersonic propeller aerodynamicsa supersonic propeller with blades attached to an infinite cylinder
ashub is studiedthe forward speed may be subsonic, but
the relative speed at each section is supersonicthe lightly
loaded blades are represented bysurface distribution of appropriate
/modified/ sources infashion similar to ordinary
supersonic thin-wing theorythese sources are found by approximating
the exact potential forconstant-strength compressible
source traveling alonghelical paththe usual relationship
between the source strength and boundary condition is
found,. and subsequently the source distribution is given, to the
appropriate order, in terms of the blade geometrytip effects are considered by extending the theory of evvard
and krasilshchikovathe present investigation, however, is
restricted to those planforms for which no vortex sheet appears
off the tipfor points in the tip region, the potential is obtained
through the appropriate distribution of /modified/ sources in the
upwash region off the tipby transforming tocurvilinear, nonorthogonal
coordinate system coincident with the modified mach
lines described by the infinities of the potential, an integral equation
for the required source distribution in the upwash region is
derivedwithout having to solve this equation, it is shown that
the potential forpoint in the tip region can be obtained in terms
of an integration of known source distributions over the blade
surface onlythe case oftwisted flat plate of particular planform is treated,
andsample calculation is made of the pressure distribution at
selected radial positions within the noncommunicating portion
of the blade, as well as over the entire tip regionthough this analysis is carried out explicitly for the supersonic
propeller, it could also be extended to calculate various rotary
derivatives for highspeed flight vehicles .oscillatory aerodynamic coefficients forunified
this investigation presentsderivation of the oscillatory
aerodynamic coefficients for wings with supersonic leading edges
from the second-order, nonlinear, unsteady, supersonic flow theory
of van dykethe theory is considered applicable throughout
the supersonic-hypersonic regime at mach numbers normal to
the leading edge and reduced frequencies for whichthe coefficients are modified for sweep, andfinite-span correction
is suggested to increase the accuracy of strip-theory flutter
analysesthe limiting values of the coefficients in steady flow
are also discussed .magnetohydrodynamic effects on the formation of couette,
this paper is concerned with the problem of the formation of
couette flow--i.e., the problem of how the velocity profile varies
with the time tending asymptotically to that of the steady flow of
an electrically conducting viscous fluid in the presence ofmagnetic
fieldthe governing equations and boundary conditions
are established and discussedthe cases of both vanishing and
nonvanishing mean induced electric field strengths are solved in
terms of complimentary error functions as well as some elementary
functionsit is shown that the solutions are reducible to
that of the steady case as the time approaches infinity, and to that
of the nonmagnetic field as the hartmann number becomes zerosome numerical calculations are giventhe results indicate
that in the presence ofmagnetic field the flow rate is reduced
depending on the magnitude of the hartmann number, and that

.real gas effects in flow over blunt bodies at hypersonic speedsa hypersonic shock tunnel has been developed to investigate the aerodynamic
characteristics of flow over bodies at conditions comparable to
those encountered by ballistic missiles and satellites re-entering the
atmospheresome results forshock velocity of over 50,000 ft. per
sec. in the shock tube portion of the facility are presentedstatic
pressure investigations were made in the nozzle to determine the flow
condition and the expansion processthe results of the investigation of representative blunt bodies at
hypersonic mach numbers and nozzle stagnation temperatures up to
approximately 6,000degreek. are presentedthese include body pressure
distributions, shock-wave shapes, detachment distances, and photographs
of the luminous gas region in the shock layerit is seen that the
shock detachment distance is smaller at higher stagnation temperatures
due to the real gas effectsfor the hemisphere the pressure distribution
was less than that predicted by the modified newtonian theory for
 all stagnation temperaturesfor50degree cone-hemisphere the pressure
distribution and the shock detachment distance were appreciably
affected by the real gas effectsthe observed shock-wave shape and the approximate boundary layer onflat plate are compared with the analytical predictionsome preliminary
results for the detached shock wave produced byblunt two-dimensional
body inlow density flow atmach number of 19.6 are presentedflow about an unsteadily rotating discan analysis is made of the unsteady laminar flow aboutrotating disc whose angular velocity may vary with timethe deviation of the actual instantaneous state of the flow from
the quasi-steady state (instantaneous steady state) is determinedfrom this,simplified criterion, is derived
to define the conditions under which the flow can be considered
as quasi-steady for the purposes of shear stress and
torque computationssinceturbulent flow responds more
rapidly thanlaminar flow, the quasi-steady criterion found here
should also serve for the turbulent situation .a three-dimensional linearized analysis of the forces
the pressure distribution onmoving flat plate induced by an
acoustic shock front striking the edge of the plate obliquely has
been found in terms of the two-dimensional solution of the authorsa study of vortex cancellationthe cancellation ofvortex by means of another concentric
vortex of equal strength but opposite spin is investigatedwhen
suchcancellation occurs, there isrecovery of static pressurethe vortices are generated by means of two three-dimensional
airfoils cantilevered from the duct wall, one being situated in the
wake of the otherthe airfoils have opposite effective angles of
attack and therefore have trailing vortices of opposite spin, as
requiredit is demonstrated experimentally that there exists an optimum
angle of attack for the second airfoil which cancels the vortex
from the first airfoil and restores uniform flow downstream of
the two airfoilsa theoretical solution of this optimum angle of
attack is presented, and it is found to depend upon the angle of
attack of the first airfoil and upon the geometrical properties of
the wingsthe pressure recovery accompanying the vortex cancellation
is also studiedtheoretical considerations, based on
the model ofvortex filament in the center ofcircular tube
show thatmaximum of 62 per cent of the static pressure drop
across the first airfoil can be recoveredthis maximum is imposed,
irrespective of skin friction and separation losses, by the
irreversibility associated with establishingvortex fieldexperimental
pressure recoveries of 50 per cent are realizedperhaps the primary value of the present study is the opportunity
it provides to verify certain of the fundamental concepts
of fluid mechanics which are brought into play when the trailing
vortex system oflifting wing is cancelled bysecond wing .transition inseparated laminar boundary layertransition to turbulence was studied inseparated laminar
boundary layer onflat plate 24 in. long and thicksteps
withheight of to were provided atdistance ofto
transition was observed throughhot-wire anemometerthe
author concludes that transition was always initiated by tollmienschlichting
wavestwo types of transition were observedin one
type, bursts suddenly appeared in the wavy flowthe other type
consists of amplification, distortion, and breaking up of the waveswhich type of transition occurs depends on the value of the following
parameter ..  boundary-layer displacement thickness times
step height times free-stream velocity squared divided by kinematic
velocity squaredthe burst type has been observed for
values of this parameter larger than 4.210the separated
laminar boundary layer becomes unstable and develops waves when
the critical reynolds  number based on boundary-layer displacement
thickness at the step location exceedsvalue of 350some
conclusions on the development of separation bubbles on air foils
are drawn from the present studies .sublimation inhypersonic environmenta priori knowledge of the response of materials subjected tosevere aerothermal environment is essential in the space agethe successful design of space and re-entry vehicles demands
that the fundamental problem of the interaction betweenmaterial
and dissociated air be properly formulated and solvedin
this paper, the problem of sublimation inhypersonic environment
is consideredin this study of hypersonic ablation, the pertinent conservation
equations are derived and the simultaneous processes of
diffusion, convection, and thermal exchange are analyzed for the
vaporization ofrefractory material which is subjected to the
environmental conditions encountered during hypersonic reentryfor simplicity, only the forward stagnation point of an axially
symmetric body is treatedit is shown that the quantity,
called the effective heat of vaporization, which includes all heat
absorbing or heat blocking effects, is an increasing function of
flight speed, independent of body size, except where nonequilibrium
vaporization effects or radiative effects appear .wings with minimum drag due to lift in supersonic flowit has been shown by r. t. jones that, in order to produce
minimum drag, the given lift must be distributed over the wing
surface in suchway that the sum of the downwash induced by
this distribution and the downwash induced in reversed flow is
constant over the wing surfacethis combined downwash can be
expressed by an integral which contains the load asfunction
of the spanwise and chordwise coordinatethe problem of
finding the appropriate load distribution is thus reduced to the
problem of finding the solution ofrather cumbersome integral
equationthe severe spanwise singularity of the kernel function is
handled most easily, as in corresponding subsonic problems, by an
approximate integration over interpolation polynomialsthe
chordwise load distribution is represented bylimited series
development in legendre polynomialsthe sigularity of the
kernel function along the mach lines through any pivotal point
can be avoided bysimilar legendre development of the combined
induced downwash which is constantthe integral equation
is thus converted intosystem of linear equations for the
unknown coefficients of the legendre functions of the load distribution
atlimited number of spanwise stationspractical calculations are carried out on an electronic computerthe solutions yield the optimum load distribution and the
local incidence (twist, camber, etc.) necessary to realize this
distributionfor many wing plan forms, considerable gains
overplane wing appear possible .turbulent heat transfer on blunt-nosed bodies in two-dimensional
recent results obtained for three-dimensional laminar boundary
layers are extended to the turbulent caseit is shown that
in the presence of highly cooled surfaces and of moderate mach
numbers of the outer stream, the crossflow and the pertaining
reynolds stresses ingeneral three-dimensional turbulent
boundary layer are negligible even for large transverse pressure
gradientsa correlation due to mager between two-dimensional
compressible and incompressible turbulent boundary
layers is extended to the problem in questionfromstudy of
the transformation and of its implications,rapid method for
the analysis of the boundary-layer flow under the subject conditions
is establishedin the absence of general three-dimensional
data,comparison with experiments and with the predictions
of other known analyses is carried out for several axisymmetric
configurations,. the results of the method presented
here exhibit good agreement with the datathe range of validity
of the cold wall approximation for general three-dimensional
problems is estimated qualitatively on the basis of recent measurements
in laminar flow, the argument being that, for either
zero or favorable streamwise pressure gradients, smaller threedimensional
effects are to be expected inturbulent boundary
layer, as compared tolaminar layer .compressible flat-plate boundary-layer flow with an
the laminar boundary-layer equations are formulated and
solved forflat plate in high-speed compressible air flow where
equilibrium dissociation and ionization are assumed and where
there is an applied magnetic field having its component normal
to the plate proportional tothe skin-friction and heattransfer
characteristics are determined for free-stream velocities
of up to 17,500 meters sec. and magnetic fields of up to aboutthe results show that the skin friction and heat transfer atgiven free-stream velocity decrease with increasing magnetic
field strength, and the percentage reduction is constant along
the length of the platethey also exhibit the same hysteresis
behavior as was first found in the case of magnetoaerodynamic
couette flow,. however, for the flat plate the hysteresis effect
disappears athigher mach numberfurthermore, it was
found that the reduction in heat transfer with increasing field
strength is opposite in behavior from that for couette flow .on shearing flow between porous coaxial cylindersthe flow between concentric porous cylinders in relative axial
motion withpressure gradient is consideredthe analysis is
restricted by the assumption that the velocity distribution isfunction of the radial coordinate only so that there is no net injection
or withdrawal of fluid at any stationthis assumption reduces
the problem tosoluble system of ordinary differential
equationsan associated heat-transfer problem is also discussed
briefly .the transition to tubulence inboundary layer on
experiments were made withseries of cones, each having an
included angle of 15 degrees, and having different tip radii (sharp
to blunt nose)the cones were tested in streams, undisturbed
mach numbers of 3.12 and 3.81, and the position of transition to
turbulence was observed withshadowgraph techniquefor each
mach number the distance to transition (distance downstream from
the tip of the cone) increased with increase in tip radius, reachedmaximum atcertain tip radius, and then decreased with increase
in tip radiusa study indicates thatreynolds number
based on the momentum thickness, instead of the length from tip to
transition, ismore appropriate parameter for correlating the datathe research scientist active in this field probably would derive
the most benefit from the original paper .experiments at hypersonic speeds on circular cones

apex-angles ranging from 25 to 45 degrees
are describedthe tests coveredrange of angles of incidence fromto
and 8.60the extent to which various
analytical and empirical theories

molecular vibration, electronic excitation
and dissociationthe gas is
assumed to be constantly in equilibrium that
is, the reaction rates are
taken to be infinitely fastthe equations
of motion are solved with the
aid ofdigital computer, previously reported
results for the state of the
shock-processed gas in the shock-tube being used .progress report on an experiment on the effect of surface
this paper describes the flexible
surfaces whose properties have
been examined and which have been tested on
an aerofoil inwind tunnelthe experiment has been rather inconclusive
as no drag reductions have been
found in turbulent flow, whilst the only
rearward movements of transition
occurred in conditions where the alteration
has been inhibited by the onset
of laminar separationthe limitations of
the experiment are discussed
carefully in order to clarify the next steps
which are to be taken with
more flexible surfaces with less damping .analysis of the fluid mechanics of secondary injection
an analysis is made of the interaction of an injected
gas or liquid withsupersonic stream,
and the force induced on an adjacent wall is predictedthe study deals only with the freestream-injectant
interaction,. the modifications to the
flow introduced by the boundary layer
are not consideredin the case of liquids, it is shown
that the momentum deficit of the injectant
relative to the freestream may playlarger part
in producing the side force than the
volume generation by vaporization and reactionthe
analytical results are compared with
those obtained from experiments inwind tunnel and in nozzles .numerical technique to lifting surface theory for calculationnumerical lifting-surface method has
been used to calculate direct gust
forces and moments on wings of several
planformsthe gust velocities are continuous
and vary sinusoidally in the stream
direction and are also uniform across
the wing spanthe procedure has the
advantage of rapid machine calculation and
includes the effects of wing planform,
nonsteady subsonic flow, and induced flow
effectsthe method provides for calculation
of gust forces onbasis consistent
with that for the calculation of forces
due to motion and deformationthe
results include the in-phase and quadrature
components of the following
quantities ..  (a) spanwise distribution of
section lift coefficient, (b) total
lift coefficient, and (c) total pitching-moment
coefficientin addition, generalized
gust forces on approximate fundamental
cantilever bending modes (parabolic)
are also includedresults have been
obtained for 60 and 75 delta wings,
ratio 11.60, and an unswept wing of aspect
ratio 6.00conditions for which calculations
were made include two mach numbers

direct gust forces and moments are in
forms suitable to be inserted in equations
of motion used in the calculation of
the dynamic responses of flexible lifting
vehicles to random turbulence and to be
compared with results from other methods .measured and calculated subsonic and transonic flutter
in order to investigate the
reliability of flutter data measured
in the langley transonic dynamics
tunnel, an experimental and theoretical
subsonic and transonic flutter study
has been conducted in air and in
freon-12 in this facilitythe wing
planform employed had an aspect
ratio of 4.0,taper ratio of 0.6,
and 45 of quarter-chord sweepbacka sting-mounted full-span model was
tested in addition to three sizes of
wall-mounted semispan modelsa wide
range of mass ratio was covered by
the tests in air and by flutter
calculations made by the modified stripanalysis
method of naca research
memorandum l57l10a limited amount of
data was obtained in freon-12results of the tests in air
and in freon-12 are in good agreement
with the flutter calculations at
all mach numbersthe test data compare
favorably with previously
published transonic flutter data for the
same wing planformthe results
indicate that flutter characteristics
obtained in freon-12 may be interpreted
directly as equivalent flutter
data in air at the same mass ratio and mach number .atmosphere entries with spacecraft lift-drag ratios
an analysis has been made of
atmosphere entries for which the
spacecraft lift-drag ratios were
modulated to limit the maximum decelerationthe parts of the drag polars
used during modulation were from
maximum lift coefficient to minimum
drag coefficientfive drag polars
of different shapes were assumed for
the spacecraftthe entries covered
wide ranges of initial velocity,
initial flight-path angle, initial
and maximum lift-drag ratiotwo-dimensional trajectory calculations were
made fornonrotating, spherical
earth with an exponential atmospherethe results of the analysis indicate
for four of the five drag polars that,
relative to the maximum deceleration
of an unmodulated entry at maximum
lift-drag ratio, the greatest reduction
in maximum deceleration obtainable
by modulation depends uponsingle
parameterthis parameter is the ratio
of the value of the aerodynamic
resultant-force coefficient at minimum
drag coefficient to the value at
maximum lift coefficientthus, the
reduction in maximum deceleration
is independent of initial velocity,
initial flight-path angle, initial
maximum lift-drag ratio, and
the shape of the drag polarfor
the fifth drag polar, the reduction in
maximum deceleration was found to
depend upon the maximum lift-drag ratioalso, relative to the depth ofgiven deceleration-limited corridor, the
greatest increase in corridor depth
obtainable by modulation (for four of
the five drag polars) depends upon
the same ratio of aerodynamic resultantforce
coefficientsthe fractional
increase in corridor depth can be
expressed as an empirically determined
analytical function of this ratio .effect of jet pluming on the static stability of cone-cylinder-flare

to 600,000geometric variables
included nose bluntness, flare half-angle,
and nozzle geometry and exit displacementtwo test nozzles with design
mach numbers of 3.74 and 4.60 were operated
with compressed air to simulate
the initial jet-boundary shape ofparticular solid-propellant
rocket motor operating between altitudes
of 165,000 and 215,000 feetthe ratio of the jet pressure to free-stream
static pressure varied fromjet-off condition to approximately 1,300
for the nozzle with design mach
number of 3.74, and fromjet-off condition
to approximately 280 for the
nozzle with design mach number of 4.60the angle-of-attack range was
fromto approximately.the results indicate that as the
jet-pressure ratio was increased
the size of the jet plume increased,
and asresult the model static
stability was decreasedincreasing
the angle of attack resulted inreduction in static instability during
the jet-on conditionincreasing
nose bluntness resulted inmore forward
movement of the center of pressure
when jet-plume interference was not
present andrearward movement
in the center of pressure when jet
interference was presentincreasing
the nozzle-area expansion ratio and
displacing the nozzle exit downstream
of the flare base resulted inmore
rearward location of the center of
pressure .design of stiffened cylinders in axial compressionthe problem of optimum design
of axially compressed cylinders

discussedparticular attention
is devoted to configurations
suitable for large launch vehiclesconsideration is given to
the analytical techniques for
determining strength as well as
the procedures for optimization .non-linear shallow shell analysis by the matrix force
the matrix force method of redundant
structure analysis is currently
being extended by various users to covernumber of non-linear problemsone of these is the non-linear analysis
of heated cambered wings, such as
might be used in advanced flight vehiclesin this case the approach used
by the present authors is equally applicable
to shallow shells, the formulation
of the strain-displacement and
equilibrium relations beingfinite element equivalent to that used
by marguerrethe solution is
obtained bycombined iteration and step
by step procedure utilizingtangent flexibility matrixdivergence
in the calculations indicates
that the range of stable configurations
has been exceededcambered
plates subjected to several loadings are
given as examples,. for one, an
exact solution is available for comparisonit is believed that the basic concepts
involved in this shallow
shell analysis can be extended to apply
to other, more general shell
instability problems, and that useful
solutions to the latter are probably
within the capability of present day digital computers .recent advances in nonequilibrium dissociating gasdynamicsthe purpose of this paper is to review some recent advances
in the study of gasdynamic problems including
effects of chemical reactionsto providebackground for
the study the general concepts shall be outlined brieflythe
discussions of the recent developments are restricted to inviscid
flow problems only, neglecting viscosity, heat conduction
and diffusionparticular attention is directed to recent
advances in analyses of nonequilibrium dissociating gas
flowsin the hypersonic flight regime, high stagnation enthalpies
sufficient to cause dissociation are realizedwhen
the time to reach equilibrium is comparable with the time it
takes forfluid particle to pass through the flow, then there
exist regions of the flow field where nonequilibrium states are
encountereda brief survey of both the linear and the nonlinear
methods of treatment of these nonequilibrium flows,
including some new developments that have not appeared
elsewhere, will be presented .non-equilibrium expansions of air with coupled chemical
analysis and solutions of the streamtube gas
dynamics involving coupled chemical rate equations
are carried outresults are presented for airflows

hypersonic nozzlesspeeds and altitudes corresponding
to re-entry were selected to obtain initial
conditions for the external flow calculationsconditions
appropriate to hypersonic tunnel testing
were chosen for the nozzle flow calculationscomposition
histories are shown forkinetic mechanism
includingspecies and 14 reactionsgas-dynamic effects
of nonequilibrium processes qualitatively
resemble those reported earlierhowever, the freezing
process is complicated by the coupling of the
nitric oxide shuffle reactions with the dissociation-recombination
reactionsin many cases of hypersonic
nozzle flows where the energy in nitrogen dissociation
is significant, the fast shuffle reactions
prevent nitrogen-atom freezing which would otherwise occur
if three-body recombination were the only
process operatingnitric oxide concentrations
undershoot the equilibrium values if the ratio of
nitric oxide to oxygen molecule concentrations
exceeds unity in the freezing regionthis depletion
of nitric oxide leads to nitrogen-atom freezing .ionization nonequilibrium in expanding flowsapproximate methods are developed for solving
the electron-ion kinetic equations in expanding
quasi one-dimensional airflowsresults are obtained
for inviscid nozzle flows at conditions appropriate
to shock tunnel testing and are compared
with exact numerical solutionseffects on rf
transmission and d-c conductivity are examinedsince two-body deionization never fully freezes
in the flows considered here, the assumption of sudden
freezing gives an upper bound on the residual
ionization at large area ratiosthe use of an
asymptotic form of solution with the freezing criterion
provides an improved estimate for such casesionization nonequilibrium is also considered
for the plasma sheath associated with blunt
hypersonic bodies flying at high altitudesthe influence of atomic ions is examined for typical
re-entry conditions .theory of radiation from luminous shock waves in nitrogenthe physical properties behindnormal shock in
nitrogen are calculated asfunction of timethese include the variation of temperature, composition,
ionization, and the intensity of radiation

experimental data are available, and regions
sensitive to particular rates are indicated .hypersonic viscous shock layera decade ago tsien (1) (as well as others) and, more recently,
adams and probstein (2) have attempted to define
the different regimes of gaseous interactions during high
altitude flightin this note some results are presented which
are pertinent to the flight of hypersonic lifting vehicles composed
of axially symmetric and two-dimensional elements,.
sec. fig..some effects of bluntness on boundary layer transition
large downstream movements of transition observed when the
leading edge ofhollow cylinder orflat plate is slightly
blunted are explained in terms of the reduction in reynolds
number at the outer edge of the boundary layer due to the detached
shock wavethe magnitude of this reduction is computed
for cones and wedges for mach numbers to 20concurrent
changes in outer-edge mach number and temperature occur
in the direction that would increase the stability of the laminar
boundary layerthe hypothesis is made that transition reynolds number is
substantially unchanged whensharp leading edge or tip is
bluntedthis hypothesis leads to the conclusion that the
downstream movement of transition is inversely proportional to
the ratio of surface reynolds number with blunted tip or leading
edge to surface reynolds number with sharp tip or leading
edgethis conclusion is in good agreement with the hollowcylinder
result at mach 3.1application of this hypothesis to other mach numbers yields
the result that blunting the tip ofslender cone or the leading
edge ofthin wedge should produce downstream movements of
transition by factors ranging fromat mach 3.0 to 30 at mach
the possible reduction in over-all heat-transfer rate and friction
drag for aircraft flying at high supersonic speedsmach number profiles near the surfaces of blunted cones and
wedges are computed for an assumed shape of the detached
shock wave at flight mach numbers to 20the dissipation and
stability of these profiles are discussed, andmethod is described
for estimating the amount of blunting required to produce
the maximum possible downstream movement of transition .compressible boundary layers on bodies of revolutioninformer paper (1) it has been shown that the behaviour
of the laminar boundary layer onbody of revolution can
be described mathematically by the same equations which are also
applied to the processes in the laminar boundary layer in the
two-dimensional flow alongbody contour, the form of which is
determined by the shape of the body of revolutiona simple
relation exists between the two-dimensional boundary layers and
the axially symmetrical onesthe flow had been assumed to be
incompressiblein this report it shall be shown that this relation
is still valid when the compressibility is taken into considerationthe distribution of velocity as well as that of temperature
in the laminar boundary layer ofbody of revolution
can be calculated by solving the corresponding problem for the
two-dimensional flow aroundsuitable contourthe method is
made clear by the example of the supersonic flow towardscone
tip,. this example has already been treated by another method
by hantzsche and wendt (2) .the development of the boundary layer in supersonic
the development of the boundary
layer invelocity shear layer is
discussed for two-dimensional flow
and for axisymmetric flow of both
compressible and incompressible fluidsit is shown that the solutions
obtained by li and glauert for the
two-dimensional flow of an incompressible
fluid are applicable in the
more general case after suitable
transformations of coordinates have
been madenew definitions are shown
to be necessary, and are given, for
the displacement and momentum thicknesses
of suchboundary layerreynolds
numbers based on these thicknesses are
given, and it is shown that any phenomenon
which occurs atconstant value of suchreynolds number will occur atpoint which, as the length scale of the
flow increases, first moves downstream
and then moves slightly upstreamthis is shown to be in qualitative
agreement with experimental results onblunt cone insupersonic flowa quantitative comparison of the theoretical
and experimental values of
displacement and momentum thicknesses is
attempted, and no disagreement is
obvious,. unfortunately the accuracy of the
experiments so far available is
insufficient to give positive confirmation
of the theory of this note .air pressure oncone moving at high speedsthe cone is considered to be
moving atvelocity higher than that
of sound, so that there is in front
of itshock wave, moving with the
same speed as the cone itselfin
the first part of the paper, the case is
investigated mathematically where
the flow is irrotational, and the pressure,
velocity and density of the air
stream are each constant over the
surfaces of cones coaxial with the
moving solid conethe complete
solution is obtained in numerical
form, for cones of semi-vertical angle
of the paper, the results are compared
with experiment, both in respect of
pressure distribution as measured inwind tunnel, and also (for the 30
cone) by comparison with photographs
of bullets in flightin the latter case
the theory should only be applicable
if the speed is 1.46 or more times the
velocity of sound, and it is in fact
found in the photographs, that the nature
of the wave alters at about this
velocitythe exact solution found, is
compared with an approximation
given recently by v. karman and moorethis should be valid for thin
spindle-shaped bodies, and does in fact
agree well in the case of the cone
of 10 semi-vertical angle, but diverges
increasingly from the truth as
the angle is increased .newtonian flow oversurfacecolston symposium ongeneral method is presented for

parameters and the angle of attack,. this
development neglectsa. ferri's
vortical layer is brought into evidencea second application is devoted to
calculation of the total forces acting
upon bodies of revolution at angles of
incidence, while neglectinggeneral formulae are
established for the coefficients of axial
force, normal force and momentsthe formulae are developed according
to the powers of incidence, the first
terms of each formula being of very simple form .a proposed programme of wind tunnel tests at hypersonicprogramme of tests at hypersonic
speeds on slender bodies is
described, which has the aim of
investigating how lift is generated, and
the compromises that may be enforced
by aerodynamic heatingthe programme
is based on models of simple geometric
shape, from which lifting configurations
will later be built up .experiments on circular cones at yaw in supersonic
pressure measurements made in the fort halstead supersonic
tunnel on two circular cones, of semiapex angles 15 and
coefficients are compared with corresponding values calculated
by theoretical methods, and the relative merits of these methods
are then discussed .laminar heat-transfer and pressure measurements at
two circular conical configurations

tested in laminar boundary layer atmach number ofand angles of
attack up to 90one cone hadsharp
nose andfineness ratio of
blunted nose withbluntness ratio
of 0.1428 andfineness ratio of 1.66pressure measurements and
schlieren pictures of the flow showed
that near-conical flow existed up
to an angle of attack of approximately
near the base and the bow shock
wave was considerably curvedcomparison of the results with
simply applied theories showed that
on the stagnation line pressures may
be predicted by newtonian theory,
and heat transfer by local yawed-cylinder
theory based on the yaw angle
of the windward generator and the local
radius of the conebase effects
increased the heat transfer inregion
extending forward approximately
circumferential pressure
distributions were higher than the
corresponding newtonian distribution
andbetter prediction was obtained
by modifying the theory to match
the pressure at 90 from the windward
generator to that on the surface
of the cone at an angle of attack of.
circumferential heat-transfer
distributions were predicted satisfactorily
up to about 60 from the
stagnation line by using lees' heat-flux
distribution based on the
newtonian pressurethe effects of nose
bluntness at large angles of
attack were very small in the region
beyond two nose radii from the
point of tangency .a guide to the use of the m. i. t.  cone tablesthe second and third volumes of the m.i.t. cone tables have
been found to be unsatisfactory in two respectsthey have been
criticized because of their inconvenient tabulation and because
the theory on which they are based is inadequate near the cone
surfacethe former is climinated by means ofcoordinate
transformationempirical evidence is presented to show that
the latter may be ignored in practicethe exact nature of certain
numerical errors in the table is also pointed out .hypersonic flows pastyawed circular cone and otherdetailed treatment of inviscid hypersonic
flow pastcircular cone is given, for
small and moderate yaw angles, within
the framework of shock-layer theorythe basic problem of non-uniform validity
associated with the singularity of
the entropy field is examined andvalid
first-order solution is obtained which
provides an explicit description ofthin
vortical layer at the inner edge of the
shock layeranalytic formulas for pressure
and circumferential velocity are
given consistent to the second-order
approximation including the non-linear
yaw effectthe study of the entropy field (which
is not restricted to the hypersonic case)
also provides corrections to previous
work on the yawed cone and confirms the
validity of the linear yaw effect on pressure
field in the stone theorya related investigation of three-dimensional
flow fields is presented with
special reference to the flow structure near
the surface ofpointed, but otherwise
arbitrary bodythe inviscid streamline
pattern on the surface is given by
the geodesics originting from the pointed
nose asleading approximation of
shock-layer theoryassociated with this
streamline pattern isvortical sublayer
which exists generally at small as well as at
large angle of attackat the base of
the sublayer, enthalpy and flow speed remain
essentially uniform .survey of inviscid hypersonic flow theory for geometricallysurvey is made of existing
theories for the calculation of pressure

hypersonic speedsno account is taken
of boundary layer displacement effects

of the newtonian approximation for
slender bodies, including the effect of
centrifugal forces, and the connection
with newtonian flow theory is emphasized forthe shock-expansion method is
described in some detail for both twoand
three-dimensional bodies, and
finally some remarks are made about the
available data sheets and tables for
estimating pressures on cones and ogivecylinders
in yawthe note does not claim to be
original, even in presentationthe aim
has been to preparereasonably complete
survey of available theory for hypersonic
flow over slender bodies, excluding
viscous and explicit real gas effectsthis will provide the background
for further work in which experimental
data will be analysed and in conjunction
with which it is hoped to produce
accurate design methods for estimating
pressures and forces on shapes intended
for sustained flight at hypersonic speeds .some simple solutions to the problem of predicting
simplified theoretical approaches
are shown, based on hypersonic
similarity boundary-layer theory,
which allow reasonably accurate estimates

of viscous effects includes
the cases where curved surfaces,

tabulated solutions are
presented for the equilibrium gas
properties behind the incident and
reflected normal shock-waves in the
shock-tube, for nitrogen and oxygenthey cover the range of shock-wave
mach numbers up to 12 at intervals of
undisturbed gas pressure betweenandthe thermodynamic model of the
gas used in the calculations
is described in some detail, as is the
method of solving the equationsthe limitations of the assumption of
thermodynamic equilibrium are discussed
with regard to shock-tube applications,
and the estimated accuracy of the
tables is indicated .on the flow inreflected shock tunnelthe performance ofshock tunnel operated by the reflected-shock technique
is examined theoretically neglecting viscous effects and hightemperature
real-gas effectsparticular attention is given to disturbances
to the flow at the nozzle entry caused by waves reflected from
 the contact surface when the operating conditions depart from those for
that the first disturbance reflected from the contact surface is weak
enough to be tolerated only withinsmall range of primary-shock mach
number,/e.g.,76if the pressure at entry to the nozzle is to
remain constant to 10 per cent/within this range, running times much
longer than those obtained in 'straight-through' shock tunnels are predicted,
the limitation usually being imposed by the arrival of the expansion
wave originating at the diaphragmoutside this range of mach number, the uniform-flow duration between the
 arrival at the nozzle entry of the primary shock and the first disturbance
reflected from the contact surface is shown to be approximately
 equal to the time between the arrival of the primary shock and the
contact surface in'straight-through' shock tunnelat first sight it
 appears, therefore, that the advantages of reflected-shock operation
are confined tovery narrow range of shock mach number, unlessheated driver gas is used in order to vary the mach number for
further analysis suggests, however, that subsequent disturbances in the
multiple wave reflection process between the contact surface and the end
 of the tube are relatively weak overuseful range of shock mach numberthus, if the flow after the arrival of the early reflected disturbances
is used for test purposes, long running times seem possible in
 theory without severe restrictions to the shock mach numberexperiments have been made inshock tube andshock tunnel to provide
data for comparisons with the results of the simple theoryif
allowance is made for viscous effects on the motion of the contact surface,
fair agreement is found for the disturbances reflected and transmitted
by the contact surface, and for the arrival of the expansion wave
reflection process increases when the shock mach number is raised substantially
above the 'tailored' value, andlimit to the usable flow
duration may resulta striking feature of the results isfall of pressure at the end of
the tube immediately after reflection of the primary shockthis is
attributed to attenuation of the reflected shock resulting from its
interaction with the boundary layer on the wall of the tubefurther
research is required to check this explanation, and to investigate the
effects of reynolds number and of the cross-sectional shape and size of
the tubethe effects of the tail and reflected head of the expansion
wave originating at the main diaphragm are discussedit is shown that
the arrival of the reflected head at the nozzle entry may imposesevere limitation to the duration of uniform conditions at low shock
mach number, and that the arrival of the tail may limit the flow duration
at high shock mach numberunless means can be devised to
suppress the expansion wave, it is demonstrated that it is desirable to
have alternative diaphragm positions intube required to operate overrange of shock mach numberit is concluded that running times of order 10 milliseconds atshock

reflected-shock operation with unheated hydrogen driving airbecause
of the simplifying assumptions of the theoretical investigations, and
the deficiencies of the apparatus used for the experiments, the present
investigation must, however, be regarded as preliminary in characterfurther research is required to check and extend the findings, and

in part (1), asfirst approach totheoretical investigation
of low aspect ratio rectangular plate wings of constant thickness,
the two assumptions are made that ..  (a) the spanwise form of
the structural distortion is known, leaving the chordwise distortion
arbitrary,. and (b) the aerodynamic forces are approximations
of the supersonic linearized theorythe form of the
chordwise distortion is then deduced from the differential equation
representing the state of neutral equilibrium for small displacements
at the critical divergence speedsecondly, this problem is investigated using measured structural
flexibility coefficients together with theoretical aerodynamic
coefficientsthirdly, the usual series solution based on the rayleigh-ritz
approach is discussed, using the same assumptions as in the first
methodall the results of these methods are consistent and indicate that
the transonic regime at=is the most critical for divergencein part (2), it is established that sweeping the leading edge ofplate airfoil of constant thickness increases its stabilityfor
angles of sweep less than 30, the critical conditions occur when
the leading edge is sonic, but for angles greater than 30 the
critical conditions occur when=.effects offlexible boundary on hydrodynamic stabilitypurpose of paper is to examine theoretically the use of coatings of
elastic materials to prevent transition from laminar to turbulent flowtheory is extension to flexible boundary of the small-disturbance
tollmien-schlichting stability theory and makes use of /tietjens
function/ and other functions that occur in solution of orr-sommerfeld

from solutions for rigid boundaryoutline and discussion is given first for tollmien-schlichting stability
 theory for rigid wall, then for theory for flexible boundarytheory
is given both fornondissipative anddissipative flexible boundarybehavior of flexible medium itself is also examinedpractical requirements are discussedfor example,conclusion is that
 to avoid tollmien-schlichting instability, the wave velocity of surface
 waves in absence of flow should coincide with tollmien-schlichting wave
 velocity at wavelength of /most dangerous/ tollmien-schlichting wavesmoreover, damping should be large enough to prevent surface waves from
developing but not so large that tollmien-schlichting waves are permissableauthor states thatboundary that is both soft and light,
one whose elastic constants are of same order as the dynamic pressure of
 the flow, may be practical for use at high speedsthis surface should
 havesmall damping to avoid tollmien-schlichting type of instability
andlarge enough wave speed without flow to avoid surface wave instabilityalthough paper is somewhat sketchy in places, it gives comprehensive
coverage of stability of laminar flow overflexible wall .qualitiative solutions of the stability equation forboundary layer in
an appropriate form of the boundary layer stability equation is
developed for the condition where the fluid is in contact with an isotropic
and homogeneous elastic medium, and various approximate analytical
solutions obtained for certain types of surface, so as to reveal at
least qualitatively the origin and characteristics of neutral oscillationsin the worked solutions the elastic medium is treated as nondissipative,
and the interior boundary is supposed either fixed, or free
 of stress, or exposed to fluid .. the boundary layer, also, is treated
as that overflat-plate in an incompressible fluidthe results obtained show that the presence of suchresiliant surface
introduces the possibility ofnumber of other modes of oscillation
schlichting wavesmost of these modes have speeds of propagation
determined largely by the properties of the elastic material, and their
presence may well be effectivelymatter of 'non-viscous' flow

mode has its minimum reynolds number increased by the presence of the
surface, but if the interior boundary is free there may be an upper
limit as wellindeed,sufficiently thin free surface, or one of low
rigidity, apparently eliminates neutral oscillations of this mode altogether,
only at the expense, however, of the introduction ofmode of
flexural waves .an investigation of the use of an auxiliary slot to
the use of an auxiliary slot onlaminar-flow
aerofoil has been investigated to check whether laminar
flow can be re-established by suction at the rear of the region
of deposited dirt, flies, etcresults indicate that in the absence of unfavourable pressure
gradients, it is possible to re-establishlaminar
boundary layer by removinglittle more than the whole turbulent
layer reaching the slot, and preliminary estimates
suggest that with efficient ducting it should be possible to achievereduction in overall effective drag coefficient by
this means .the effect on transition of isolated surface excrescences
the effect of isolated surface excrescences inlaminar boundary layer in producing disturbances
which may lead to turbulent flow has been examined
experimentally by several methodsphotographs of some
of the flow patterns visualised by smoke and china-clay
techniques are giventhe critical heights of pimple which just give rise to
spreading wedges of turbulent flow have been measured
onflat plate and on two aerofoils at several angles of
incidencethe results are analysed and are presented inform which enables approximate estimates to be made of the
protuberances permissible on laminar-flow surfaces at
full-scale flight reynolds numbersthe estimates suggest
that at an altitude of 30,000 ft the critical pimple height
is 0.004 in. forspeed of 350 m.p.h., whilst 0.002 in.
may be permissible at all subsonic speedsat sea-level,
however, the tolerances are approximately halved .experiments on the use of suction through perforated
wind-tunnel tests are described in which suction
is applied at perforated strips, as an alternative to
porous strips or slots, in order to maintainlaminar boundary
layera test was first carried out onsingle row of
perforations oncambered plate, aspreliminary to the main
tests which were performed on strips of multiple rows
of perforations drilled through the surface oflow-drag-type
aerofoil 13 per cent thick and of 5-ft chordup towind speed of 180 ft sec it has been ascertained that
suction may be safely applied to extend laminar flow
provided the ratio of hole diameter to boundary-layer displacement
thickness is less than 2, the ratio of hole pitch to
diameter is less thanand there are at least three rows of holes
in the stripwith less than three rows, the criteria
are much more restrictiveit is possible to extend laminar flow
by suction through perforations whose diameters and
pitches exceed these values slightly, but only with the risk that
excessive suction quantities will produce wedges of
turbulent boundary layer originating at the holesa uniform distribution of suction through the holes was
necessarythis was successfully obtained by two methods,
the use of cells and throttle holes, and with tapered holesin particular, tests were carried out on some panels
supplied by handley page, ltd., in which the cells and tapered
holes had been constructed by commercial methods, and
the suction distribution proved satisfactorythe resistance of some of the cellular arrangements was
measuredit was found that when the suction quantities
were the minimum required to maintain laminar flow, the
additional losses in total head of the sucked air due to
the resistance of the throttle holes could be made small compared
with the loss in total head of the sucked boundary

the efficiency of lift or thrust production
by heat addition on twodimensional
bodies is approximately the same
as that forturbojetpowered
two-dimensional bodythe
efficiency is somewhat higher at low
supersonic mach numbers and behaves
as, decreasing toconstant value as increaseson the other hand, the efficiency of

various degrees of freedom contribute
to the responses is examined and
in this connection the relative effects
of static and dynamic aeroelasticity
are determined .calculated spanwise lift distributions, influence functions
spanwise lift distributions have been calculated for nineteen
unswept wings with various aspect ratios and taper ratios and
withvariety of angle-of-attack or twist distributions, including
flap and aileron deflections, by means of the weissinger method
with eight control points on the semispanalso calculated
were aerodynamic influence coefficients which pertain tocertain definite set of stations along the span, and several
methods are presented for calculating aerodynamic influence
functions and coefficients for stations other than those stipulatedthe information presented herein can be used in the analysis
of untwisted wings or wings with known twist distributions, as
well as in aeroelastic calculations involving initially unknown
twist distributions .aerodynamic forces on wings in non-uniform motionthe problem of determining the aerodynamic forces
acting on wings of finite span in non-uniform motion
in an incompressible, inviscid fluid is investigatedthe underlying
theory is outlined in 2, and some known results
for the case of an aerofoil of infinite span are included in.  it is
shown in 4, by the use of operational methods,
that the growth of lift function(s) corresponding tosudden unit
change of incidence can be derived from the lift
function corresponding to simple harmonic translational motionfrom results given by the writer for rectangular
wings (1943) and tapered wings (1945) in simple harmonic motion

corresponding to damped and growing translational oscillations are
derivedcertain integrals involved in the theory are evaluated in
appendix 1, and in appendixthe method of determining(s), when(s) is known, is discussed in detailit is suggested that the aerodynamic forces acting on wings
of finite span for any type of motion can best be derived
fromknowledge of the forces corresponding to purely
divergent motion, which can be calculated by the methods
outlined in this report .calculated spanwise lift distributions and aerodynamic
spanwise lift distributions have been calculated for 61 swept wings

to condense during an adiabatic
expansion from normal
conditions up tomach number
of.  the values of the
ratio of specific heats
for freon-12 are lower than
that for air, and therefore
an additional parameter is
introduced, which must be
considered when comparisons
are made of aerodynamic tests
using freon-12 with those
using airthe time lag of the
vibrational heat capacity
of freon-12 tochange in
temperature has been
measured and found to be
of the order ofx 10 second
at atmospheric temperature
and pressurethis time
is so short that no important
energy dissipations
should result in most
engineering applications .studies of the use of freon-12 aswind tunnel testingnumber of studies relating to
the use of freon-12 assubstitute medium for air in aerodynamic
testing have been madethe
use of freon-12 instead of air makes
possible large savings in windtunnel
drive powerbecause of the
fact that the ratio of specific
heats is approximately 1.13 for freon-12
as compared with 1.4 for air,
some differences exist between data
obtained in freon-12 and in airmethods for predicting aerodynamic
characteristics of bodies in air

chord, 46 percent chord, and 58 percent chord, respectively, were
fluttered at several mach numbers between 0.8 and 1.35it was found that, for streamwise mach numbers from 0.8 to 1.0, the
variation with mach number of the ratio of experimental flutter speed tocalculated incompressible flutter speed was not affected by centerof-gravity
locationhowever, for mach numbers from 1.0 to 1.35, there
was an increase in flutter-speed ratio with mach number which was
different for each center-of-gravity positiondata from wings with
successively more forward center-of-gravity locations showed successively
larger values of flutter-speed ratio at mach numbers from 1.0 tocalculation of flutter characteristics for finite-span swept or unsweptmethod has been developed for calculating flutter characteristics of
finite-span swept or unswept wings at subsonic and supersonic speedsthe method is basicallyrayleigh type analysis and is illustrated with
 uncoupled vibration modes although coupled modes can be usedthe
aerodynamic loadings are based on distributions of section lift-curve
slope and local aerodynamic center calculated from three-dimensional
steady-flow theorythese distributions are used in conjunction with
the /effective/ angle-of-attack distribution resulting from each of the
assumed vibration modes in order to obtain values of section lift and
pitching momentcirculation functions modified on the basis of loadings
for two-dimensional airfoils oscillating incompressible flow are
 employed to account for the effects of oscillatory motion on the magnitudes
and phase angles of the lift and moment vectorsflutter characteristics have been calculated by this method for 12 wings
 of varying sweep angle, aspect ratio, taper ratio, and center-ofgravity
position at mach numbers fromto as high as 1.75comparisons
 of the results with experimental flutter data indicate that this method
 gives generally good flutter results forbroad range of wings .method of controlling stiffness properties ofsolid-constructionsimple method is presented for controlling the bending and torsional
stiffnesses ofsolid-construction model wingthe method consists of
weakening the wing by drilling holes through the wing normal to the
chord planeaerodynamic continuity is maintained by filling the holes
withrelatively soft materialthe important parameters controlling
the stiffnesses are the amount of material removed by drilling, the
ratio of hole diameter to wing thickness, and the plan-form pattern of
the holesdata are given which may be used for predicting the stiffness
ofmodel wing weakened in this manner .investigation of wing flutter at transonic speeds for six systematically
an investigation of the effects of systematic variations in wing plan
form on the flutter speed at mach numbers between 0.73 and 1.43 has been
 conducted in the 26-inch langley transonic blowdown tunnelthe angle
of sweepback was varied from 0degree to 60degree on wings of aspect
ratio 4, and the aspect ratio was varied fromtoon wings with
experimental flutter speed and the reference flutter speed calculated on
 the basis of incompressible two-dimensional flowthis ratio, designated
as the flutter-speed ratio, is plotted asfunction of mach number
for the various wingsit is found that the flutter-speed ratio
increased rapidly past sonic speed for sweep angles of 45degree and
less, indicatingfavorable effect of mach numberfor sweepback of
mach number range of the testsreducing the aspect ratio hadfavorable
effect on the flutter-speed ratio which was of the order of 100
percent higher for the aspect-ratio-2 wing than for the aspect-ratio-6
wingthis percentage difference was nearly constant throughout the
mach number range, indicating that the effect of mach number was about
the same for all aspect ratios tested .the calculation of aerodynamic loading on surfaces of any shapethe object of the report is to establishroutine method for the calculation
of aerodynamic loads on wings of arbitrary shapethe method
developed is based on potential theory and usesgeneral mathematical
formula for continuous loading onwing which is equivalent todouble
 fourier series with unknown coefficientsin order to evaluate the
unknown coefficients the continuous loading is split up intoregular
pattern of horseshoe vortices, the strengths of which are proportional
to the unknown coefficients and to standard factors which are given intablethe total downwash at chosen pivotal points is obtained by
summing the downwashes due to the individual vortices,process which
is simplified by the use of specially prepared tables of the properties
of the horseshoe vortexby equating the downwash to the slope of the
wing at each pivotal point, simultaneous equations are obtained, the
solution of which defines the unknown coefficientsthe first layout involvestotal of 76 vortices over the wing, andsecond layout, involvingtotal of 84, is shown to be of superior
accuracythe effect on the solution of the number of pivotal points is
 investigated and it is concluded that bysuitable choice, it is unnecessary
to uselarge numberresults forrectangular wing at

errors in published results in at least one of these casesimmediate
development includes the application to the calculation of the characteristics
of actual sweptback wings, including rotary derivatives, and
 future development includes also applications in wind tunnel design and
 technique .formulas for the supersonic loading, lift and drag
the method of superposition of linearized conical flows has
been applied to the calculation of the aerodynamic properties, in
supersonic flight, of thin flat, swept-back wings at an angle of
attackthe wings are assumed to have rectilinear plan forms,
with tips parallel to the stream, and to taper in the conventional
sensethe investigation covers the moderately supersonic speed
range where the mach lines from the leading-edge apex lie ahead
of the wingthe trailing edge may lie ahead of or behind the
mach lines from its apexthe case in which the mach cone
from one tip intersects the other tip is not treatedformulas are obtained for the load distribution, the total lift,
and the drag due to liftfor the cases in which the trailing edge
is outside the mach cone from its apex (supersonic trailing edge),
the formulas are completefor the wing with both leading and
trailing edges behind their respective mach lines,degree of
approximation is necessaryit has been found possible to give
practical formulas which permit the total lift and drag to be
calculated to withinorpercent of the accurate linearizedtheory
valuethe local lift can be determined accurately over

approximatelycharts of some of the functions derived are included to facilitate
computing, and several examples are worked out in outline .atmospheric entries with vehicle lift-drag ratio modulated
an analysis has been made of
atmosphere entries for which the
vehicle lift-drag ratio was modulated
to maintain specified maximum
decelerations and or maximum deceleration
ratesthe part of the
vehicle drag polar used during modulation
was from maximum lift coefficient
to minimum drag coefficientthe
entries were at parabolic velocity
and the vehicle maximum lift-drag ratio
was 0.5two-dimensional trajectory
calculations were made fornonrotating, spherical earth with an
exponential atmospherethe results
of the analysis indicate that forgiven initial flight-path angle,
modulation generally resulted inreduction
of the maximum deceleration
to 60 percent of the unmodulated value orreduction of maximum deceleration
rate to less than 50 percent of the
unmodulated ratethese results were
equivalent, formaximum deceleration
of 10g, to lowering the undershoot
boundary 24 miles withresulting
decrease in total convective heating to
the stagnation point of 22 percenthowever, the maximum convective heating
rate was increased 18 percent,. the
maximum radiative heating rate and total
radiative heating were each
increased about 10 percent .the use of aerodynamic lift during entry into the earth's
by employing aerodynamic lift during entry into the earth's
atmosphere at either orbital or /escape/ velocity, the range of
allowable entry angles forprescribed peak deceleration is
greatly increased, while the total heat energy transferred to the
vehicle can be held to about the same value as fornonlifting
vehicleonly modest lift-drag ratios are required beyond peakto prevent the deceleration from exceeding the peak value, or to
prevent the vehicle from skipping out of the earth's atmospherethus, the difficult guidance and control problem is greatly
alleviated,. in particular, for return from the moon or other
planets the necessity for multiple-pass drag braking is eliminated .modulated entrythe technique of modulation, or variable coefficients, is discussed
and the analytical formulation is reviewedrepresentative numerical
results of the use of modulation are shown for the lifting and
nonlifting casesthese results include the effects of modulation on
peak acceleration, entry corridor, and heat absorptionresults are
given for entry at satellite speed and escape speedthe indications
are that coefficient modulation onvehicle with good lifting
capability offers the possibility of sizable loading reductions or,
alternatively, wider corridors,. thus, steep entries become practical
from the loading standpointthe amount of steepness depends on the
acceptable heating penaltythe price of sizable fractions of the
possible gains does not appear to be excessive .approximate analysis of atmospheric entry corridorssimple closed-form solution
for the achievable corridor depths
and entry angles asfunction of
g-load limit, entry velocity, and
vehicle aerodynamics and thermodynamics
is developed for two modes of
vehicle operation, constant angle
of attack and modulated angle of attackfor constant angle of attack,
operation at maximum negative lift
coefficient on the overshoot bound,
and at an angle of attack between
zero and that for maximum lift-drag
ratio on the undershoot bound, gives
the deepest corridorfor modulated
angle of attack, operating at maximum
negative lift coefficient on the
overshoot bound and modulating
the angle of attack from maximum
positive lift coefficient to zero on
the undershoot bound give the deepest
corridorthe modulated angle of
attack gives corridor depths two to
four times larger than the fixed
angle of attackfor both cases the
corridor depth is increased by increasing
maximum lift-drag ratio,
increasinglimit, and decreasing
entry velocityconsideration of hot-gas radiation
placeslimit on the maximum
angle of attack for either mode of
operationifmaximum free-stream
reynolds number limit must be placed
on the vehicle to ensurelaminar
boundary layer, the deep atmospheric
penetrations associated with configurations
with high lift-drag ratio
may be ruled outboth of these
thermodynamic considerations reduce
the acceptable corridor depth below
the value calculated from aerodynamic
considerations alone .radiative heat transfer during atmosphere entry at
stagnation point radiative heating
rates for manned vehicles entering
the earth's atmosphere at parabolic
velocity are presented and compared
with corresponding laminar convective
heating ratesthe calculations
were made for both nonlifting and lifting
entry trajectories for vehicles
of varying nose radius, weight-to-area
ratio, and dragit is concluded
from the results presented that radiative
heating will be important for
the entry conditions considered .effects of simulated rocket jet exhaust on stability

divergent section of the nozzle and thus
reducing the jet-static-pressure

were made of the pressures
over the rear of the body with the primary
variables being angle of attack,

showed that the radial pressures
over the body varied appreciably
from the distribution generally
employed in most approximate theoriesthe linearized solutions for lift,

of the experimental resultsan analysis
of several theoretical methods
for calculating pressure distribution and

about 6.5 was obtained, the flow in the
test section was not sufficiently
uniform for quantitative wind-tunnel test
purposesdeviations from the
design flow were traced to the presence
ofthick boundary layer which
developed in the first step along the
parallel walls .investigation of the flow throughsingle stage two

drag of thin wings atmach number of about 6.8
and zero angle of attackthe pressure measurements
atmach number of 9.6 were made in the
presence of substantial heat transfer from the
boundary layer to the plate surfacethe measured
pressure distribution on the surface of the plate was
predicted with good accuracy bymodification to
insulated-plate displacement theory which allows
for the effect of the heat transfer and temperature
gradient along the surface on the boundary-layer
displacement thicknessthe total drag of thin wings with square and delta
plan forms was measured atnominal mach number
of 6.8 overreasonably wide range of reynolds
numbersthe total drag was found to be greater
than can be explained by addingclassical value of
laminar skin friction to the estimated pressure dragthe difference is, in general, explained by the increase
in skin friction (20 to 40 percent) caused by
the boundary-layer-induced pressures .secondary flow fields embedded in hypersonic shock

of the applicability of newtonian

in uniform streams suggests that this
theory can be expected to giveuseful approximation to the surface
pressuresa pressure equation based on this
concept predictsnumber of
interesting things ..  first, pressures
can differ from simple newtonian
theory by factors of5 to 3,. for
example, on flare stabilizers on bluntnosed
bodies of revolution, pressures
are lower than newtonian and diminish
with increasing flight speed in the
hypersonic speed rangethe calculated
pressures vary over the flare surface
asresult of the nonuniformity of
its incident stream, and depend on the
axial location of the flarein

these differ from conventional newtonian
theory by the ratio of local

six circular cylinders stiffened longitudinally by closely spaced
z-section stringers were loaded to failure in compressionthe results
obtained are presented and compared with available theoretical results
for the buckling of orthotropic cylindersthe results indicate that
the large disparity that exists between theory and experiment for
unstiffened compression cylinders may be significantly smaller for
stiffened cylinders .simplified analysis of general instability of stiffened
although much work has been done to developtheory for
the failure of shells by general instability, there is at present no
simple method by which the size of the frames may be determined
for any given diameter, bending moment,.and frame spacingsuchmethod is needed in determining the optimum design for
stiffened shells, to be used asbasis for weight analysis of fuselages,
and other shell structuresin an extension of the work
done for the rand corporation,simple coefficient has been
determined for this purposesince it appears that this method
may also be useful in design calculations,brief description is
presented below .large deflections of structures subjected to heating
the method of direct formulation of the stiffness matrix is
extended to include the effects of nonuniform heating and large
deflectionsthe purpose is to develop an analytical tool for the
treatment of actual structuresin the solution of aeroelastic problems the relations between
forces and deflections must be determinedthe usual stiffness
matrix formulation of this relationship is limited to small temperature
changes and small deflectionsfor large temperature
changes additional terms are requiredalso the problem becomes
geometrically nonlinear when large deflections are involvedto overcome the inherent difficulties of the nonlinear
problem for practical structures either an iterative orstep-bystep
procedure must be usedthe force-deformation relations
necessary for this step-by-step or iterative approach are derived
for an axially loaded member and forplate element including
the effects of thermal strains .non-linear analysis of heated, cambered wings by the matrix force
various extensions of the matrix force method for complex structure
analysis are presented and illustrated with the objective of expanding
its range to handle the problems likely to be encountered in advanced
vehicle wing designmethods are covered in detail for (1) determining
the change in flexibility that occurs when thermal stresses are present,
and also how large these stresses must be to cause buckling, (2)
including the non-linear effect of large deflections by an iterative
procedure, and (3) analyzingwing that is initially slightly cambered
and warped with either or both of the aforementioned effects presentformulas are given for calculating the input matrix terms as are the
matrix equations and supporting theoretical discussionan example
illustrates the nature and magnitude of the effects being examined .a characteristic type of instability in the large deflections
part 1. fromgeneral equation governing
the bending of thin elastic plates into certain
types of surfaces of revolution are derived

with initial curvatures, subjected to pure
bending about one axisit is found that such
plates exhibit the type of instability characteristic

for their stiffness on curvaturecurves are
drawn showing the deformation suffered by
such plates, and an expression for the critical

an account is given of an investigation into the interaction between the
 boundary layer onflat plate andshock wave produced either externally,
bywedge in the supersonic mainstream, or from within the
boundary layer, bywedge held in contact with the platea wide range
 of free-stream mach numbers, boundary-layer reynolds numbers, and shock
 strengths has been covered, shock strength being defined as the ratio
of the static pressure downstream of the shock to the static pressure
upstream of itvariations in these parameters can have large effects
on the interaction, and there are also large differences between cases
with externally generated shocks and cases where the shock is generated
from within the boundary layerthe investigation has thrown light on
the physical mechanisms involvedit is found that many of the major
features of the interaction arise because the boundary layer separates
from the surface ahead of the shock wavethe conditions under which
separation occurs and the behaviour of the separated boundary layer thus
 have important effects, in terms of which, for example, the differences
 between the interactions observed with laminar and with turbulent
boundary layers may be explained .approximate calculation of the laminar boundary layerafter analyzinglarge class of boundary-layer velocityprofiles,
the author discovered that the functions l(m) and
h(m) for all such cases differ only slightly from each other
over the whole range of positive and negative pressure gradientshere l,andare defined by
being the velocitycomponent
in thedirection andthe value ofat the
edge of the boundary-layer and and the displacement
and momentum thickness, respectivelybased on this discovery,
an approximate method is proposed by constructing
two universal curves l(m) and h(m) for all conceivable
boundary-layer flows found in practiceonce these are
chosen, karman's momentum-integral can be written in the
form,being the kinematic viscosity
coefficient, and can be integrated numericallyas
examples, both howarth's and hartree's
tained is considered good for practical purposes .the compressible laminar boundary layer with heat transfer
an approximate method for the calculation of the compressible
laminar boundary layer with heat transfer and
arbitrary pressure gradient, based on thwaites' correlation
concept, is presentedthe method results from the application
of stewartson's transformation to prandtl's equations, which
yeildsnonlinear set of two first-order differential equationsthese equations are then expressed in terms of dimensionless
parameters related to the wall shear, the surface heat transfer,
and the transformed free-stream velocitythwaites' concept
of the unique interdependence of these parameters is assumedthe evaluation of these quantities is then carried out by utilizing
exact solutions recently obtainedwith the resulting relations, methods are derived for the
calculation of the two-dimensional and axially symmetric
laminar boundary layer with arbitrary free-stream velocity
distributionmach number, and surface temperature levelthe combined effect of heat transfer and pressure gradient
is demonstrated by applying the method to calculate the characteristics
of the boundary layer on thin supersonic surfaces
and inhighly cooled, convergent-divergent, axially symmetric
rocket nozzle .a theoretical investigation of the effects of mach number, reynolds
laminar separation in supersonic flow is investigated by an extension of
 stratford's methodit is assumed that separation is of the usual
practical type, taking place upstream of the shock wave or other agency
provoking itthe results of the analysis agree well in most respects
with experiment .three dimensional viscous wakesthe velocity fields of three-dimensional
viscous wakes are examined with the
use of the boundary-layer approximations,
osoen's linearization of the convective
terms, and the assumption of constant
fluid propertiestransform methods
yield solutions for general types of initial
conditionsas an illustration, the
axial velocity distribution ofwake whose
initial isovels (lines of constant velocity)
are of elliptic shape and their decay
to axial symmetry are demonstratedboth laminar and turbulent flows are considered .steady motion ofsphere., oseens's criticism and solutionthe formula of stokes for the resistance experienced slowly
moving sphere has been employed in physical researches of fundamental
importance, asmeans of estimating the size of minute globules of
water, and thence the number of globules contained incloud of
given massconsequently the conditions of its validity has been much
discussed both from the experimental and from the theoretical side .some remarks on the flat plate boundary layerthe authors discuss the solutions for the flow ofviscous
incompressible fluid near the leading edge ofsemi-infinite
flat plate without pressure gradientthe oseen linearization
is employed which approximates the equations of motion
and continuity by
where are the coordinate directions, the corresponding
velocity components and the uniform free stream
velocity which is parallel to the platedefiningperturbation
stream function by
the differential equation
to be solved is with boundary conditions
far from the plate and
when y=0 andthe authors discuss the
problem by applying the two-dimensional fourier transform
and obtain an explicit solution for the velocity gradient
at the plate which is in disagreement
with the result of the blasius solutionfrom this
the authors conclude that it would be more appropriate to
usevelocity other than in the linearization of the
equations of motion and suggest replacing by wherethis choice does not affect the solution far from
the plate but gives on the plate and in
comparison with blasius solution indicates that c=0.35the solution of the modified oseen equation with this value
ofthen seems acceptable as the approximate solution in
the region intermediate between the stokes flow and the
free streamon the basis of these considerations, the authors
suggest an iteration procedure for obtaining the exact solution
for the above problem as well assolution for the plate
of finite length .axisymmetric free mixing with swirlviscous laminar axially-symmetric
free-mixing with small, moderate,
and large swirl is investigated byboundary layer type of analysis with
integral methodsmoderate and small
swirls are formally the same, differing
only in the order of their associated
radial pressure gradientsneither
induces significant axial pressure gradients,.
consequently their effect on the
axial flow is negligiblefor moderate and
small swirl an interesting feature
is the swirl decayin both compressible
and incompressible flow, it is
shown that jet swirl decays more rapidly
than wake swirl whereas both swirls
decay more rapidly than the non-uniformity
in axial velocitylarge swirl
generates axial pressure gradients as well
as large radial pressure gradients,
and therefore alters the streamwise flowexamples calculated for incompressible
flow, show that the wake is
lengthened by large swirlit is expected
that this effect will be diminished
in the presence of higher free-stream
mach numbers which lead to decreased
densities, due to decreased centrifugal
effects, decreased radial pressure
gradients, and decreased axial pressure
gradients .on axially symmetric, turbulent, compressible mixing in the presence
recent experimental results have shown that the
mixing of heterogeneous gases having an initial velocity
ratio close to unity occurs faster than is predicted by classical
eddy-viscosity theorythe theoretical analysis of two uniform
streams of different gases but of nearly equal velocity,
performed with the usual assumptions for eddy viscosity and
prandtl number equal toconstant, shows that mixing will
take place very slowly, i.e., at the rate corresponding to
laminar diffusionit has been suggested that the difference
between analysis and experiment could be attributed to the
presence ofboundary layer in the experimentsit is the
purpose of this note to show that the use of the classical eddyviscosity
law, admitting the existence ofboundary layer,
is not sufficient to explain the rapid mixing that is observed
physicallyinstead, it is shown that rapid mixing can be
explained on the basis ofdifferent eddy-viscosity law, as
was suggested in ref..  these conclusions are obtained
through application of the analysis presented briefly below .nose drag in free-molecule flow and its minimizationthe superaerodynamic nose drag ofbody infree-molecule
flow involves two parameters ..  the speed ratiobetween
ordered and random molecular motions (modified mach number),
and the temperature ratio between the solid surface
and undisturbed gassimplifications of the drag formula are
obtained at hypersonic as well as low-subsonic extremesto
minimize the drag onnose of specified length and base radius,
the ordinary method of calculus of variation was found inadequatea generalized approach has, accordingly, been developed,
and the specification of end conditions is discussed at lengthresults of the present investigation indicate that in all cases
an optimum nose requiresflat tipthe optimum nose curve
for the hypersonic extreme does not depend on the temperature
ratio, but that for the low-subsonic extreme varies in the following
manner ..  forhot body the curve is convex,. forcold body,
concavean optimum solution exists inrestricted range of
specification onlywith prescribed tip and base radii the admissible
nose length is bounded below for the cases of hypersonic
and low-subsonic hot body and bounded above for the case of
low-subsonic cold bodya vanishing tip radius leads to an infinitely
long nose in the former andvanishing nose in the latter
caseoptimum nose curves for several temperature ratios at the lowsubsonic
extreme, as well as the one for hypersonic extreme, are
presentedit is observed that at the low-subsonic extreme, with,
the hot-body solution asymptotically approaches
the hypersonic solution--i.e.,slender conventional warhead
withflat tip,. whereas with, the cold-body solution
asymptotically approaches the minimal-surface solution--i.e.,
tip radius,flat disc .theoretical analysis of turbulent mixing of reactive

model for the compressible eddy viscosity,
the momentum equation is reduced toform
amenable to approximate solutionthe resulting
velocity distribution in both incompressible and
compressible flows is in reasonable agreement with
experimentthe usual assumptions with respect
to chemical behavior, namely either frozen or
equilibrium flow, and to unity lewis numbers
and prandtl number are employedthe theoretical
results for chemical equilibrium are shown
to be in reasonable agreement with experimental data
from low speed hydrogen flamesa numerical
example of interest in connection withhypersonic,
air breathing vehicle is carried out in detail .an approximate solution for the axisymmetric jet oflaminar
an extension of the modified-oseen method of carrier, based on the
linearization of the viscous term of the von mises transformation,
is presentedthe method is employed to determine the velocity field
associated with the laminar axisymmetric jet flow ofcompressible
gas with an arbitrary but constant external flowthe approximate
solution is shown to be in good agreement with the exact numerical
calculation of paiin many boundary layer problems it is not possible to make the
assumption of flow similaritythe solution in these cases can be
obtained either by laborious finite difference techniques or by
resort to approximate solutionscarrier and lewis (1), and more
recently carrier (2), have suggestedmethod of obtaining approximate
solutions to problems involving convection and diffusionthis
method, termed by carrier /the modified-oseen method/, overcomes an
essential difficulty of integral methods, namely, the generation of
reasonable profilesit is well known that the integral method gives
accurate results only if the analytical profiles represent closely
the true profilesaccording to the modified-oseen method the
convective operator in the original partial differential equation
is replaced bylinear onethe resulting equation for the
boundary layer problem is the heat conduction equation which can be
treated by well-known techniquesit is the purpose of this paper to indicatemodification of this
procedure and to demonstrate its simplicity and accuracy by treating the
axisymmetric laminar flow ofcompressible gas with arbitrary but
constant external flowthe modification is based on the use of the
von mises transformation withsubsequent linearization of the viscous
term, rather than the linearization of the convective termpai's
problem (3), originally treated byfinite difference technique,
is considered to illustrate the effectiveness of this method .some applications in physics of the p-functionthe mathematical background and typical applications

types of long-range vehicle, the ballistic, the glide, and the skip
rocketperformance assessments are made on the basis of an ingenious,
if debatable, conversion of the vehicle characteristics to the breguet
formulathe problems of aerodynamic heating, aerodynamic loads and
stability are briefly discussed, and other aspects of hypersonic flight
free molecule flow-dash are touched uponthe results on the whole
favor the glide vehicle for manned flightthe subsequent discussion
on the paper includes references to multistaging and the use of highenergy
fuels .the problem of obtaining high lift-drag ratios at supersonic speedsthe importance of the lift to drag ratio is well
known to all aircraft designers since it gives, togreat extent, the aerodynamic efficiency of the airplaneaerodynamic efficiency, however, is only one
component of the grand compromise thatcompleted
airplane representsat subsonic speeds, lift-drag
ratios of well over 200 have been measured in wind
tunnels on airfoil sections., but few powered aircraft
have attained (lift to drag ratio) value of 20it is invariably true
that the requirements of stability and control, structure,
and flight operation all contribute to reducing the
design (lift to drag ratio) considerably below those exotic values
which can be predicted from unrestricted aerodynamic
theoryif, however,certain range or operating
efficiency is required, there is most certainlyminimum
if we examine the range equation we see that range is
proportional to the lift-drag ratio, the thermopropulsive
efficiency, and the logarithm of the initial to final
weight ratiothe appearance of the lift-drag ratio aslinear factor in the range equation indicates that every
attempt should be made to increase (lift to drag ratio)., however,
the search for higher (lift to drag ratio) may lead to strange
and unorthodox configurationsmost frequently, such
configurations are ruled out by the adverse effects of
their geometry on the weight ratiosin the present
paper, we will deal with the maximum lift-drag ratio
problem for conventional configurations havingwing
andbody in close proximity to each otherno attempt
will be made to selectparticular configuration
as being the besthowever, the promising direction
to go from the aerodynamic view will be stressed with
the understanding that the other factors may outweight
the aerodynamics .effect of mach number on boundary layer transition
the effect of mach number variation

of the test showed that increasing mach
number hadvery favorable effect
of increasing the extent of the laminar
boundary layer forgiven surface
roughnessthe transition data, when
plotted asfunction offactor
indicative of heat transfer, showed that
heat transfer was possibly responsible
forgood deal of the increase in
transition reynolds number with
mach numbertransition was found to occur
farther forward on the sheltered side
of the body than on the windward side
for angles of attack as low as 0.4
and for all mach numbersthe pressure
rise along sheltered-side streamlines
was examined and it was found
that the pressure-rise coefficient
at the transition point, showed no
variation with mach numberdata from
other sources for different test
conditions, when reduced to values of
pressure-rise coefficient, were also
found to correlate well with that of
the present investigation with the
exception of data at low subsonic mach

infinite laminar stability to
small two-dimensional disturbances as
calculated forflat plate with
zero pressure gradient .the solution of the equations of the laminar boundary
the solution of the equations of the laminar
boundary layer has been carried out for the pressure
distribution for an elliptic cylinder of axial ratio 2.96 ..with
its major axis in the direction of the incident streamthe solution has been obtained by the method of hartree and
womersleyin applying this method the derivatives
parallel to the boundary are replaced by finite differences, so
that the partial differential equation of the boundary
layer is replaced by an ordinary equation relating the velocity
distribution through the boundary layer at one section
to that at another, at an interval upstreamby two independent
integrations covering the same range by finite intervals
of different sizes, it is possible to estimate the errors
involved in replacing the derivatives by finite differences,
and so to correct for these errorsthe process of solution requires the values of the pressure
gradient along the solid boundary, and there iscertain
tolerance in the derivation of the pressure gradient distribution
fromlimited number of observed values of pressurean analysis of schubauer's pressure distribution is outlined, and
the results were used for the main solution calculatedit is found that the solution, for the distribution of pressure gradient
so derived, does not give separation of the boundary
layer from the solid boundary, whereas the actual flow does separateit is found that the calculated solution is very sensitive to
the pressure distribution, andcomparatively small
modification of the pressure distribution givessolution which
does indicate separation close to the point at which
separation is observed to occurthe solution with this pressure
distribution also gives very good agreement with the
observed velocity distribution through the boundary layer at
points upstream from separation .on the theory of laminar boundary layer involving separationthe paper presentsmathematical discussion of the
laminar boundary layer, which was developed withview
of facilitating the investigation of those boundary layers
in particular for which the phenomenon of separation
occursthe treatment starts withslight modification of
the form of the boundary layer equation first published by
von misestwo approximate solutions of this equation
are found, one of which is exact at the outer edge of the
boundary layer while the other is exact at the wallthe
final solution is obtained by joining these two solutions
at the inflection points of the velocity profilesthe final
solution is given in terms ofseries of universal functions
forfairly broad class of potential velocity distributions
outside of the boundary layerdetailed calculations of
the boundary layer characteristics are worked out for the
case in which the potential velocity islinear function of
the distance from the upstream stagnation pointfinally
the complete separation point characteristics are determined
for the boundary layer associated withpotential
velocity distribution made up of two linear functions of
the distance from the stagnation pointit appears that
extensions of the detailed calculations to more complex
potential flows can be fairly easily carried out by using
the explicit formulae given in the paper .a theoretical calculation of the laminar boundary layer
the author, in conjunction with th. von karman,
has recently givennew method of approximate
integration of the prandtl boundary layer equations,
which was developed in order to treat cases in which
separation oflaminar boundary layer might be expectedthe method was developed because some doubt
was felt as to the accuracy with which the well-known
pohlhausen analysis would describe conditions in the
neighborhood of suchseparation pointnumerical
calculations were carried out for certain cases involving
theoretical simplifications, and very considerable discrepancies
were found between the results of the new
and pohlhausen methodsthe method was also used
in developingtheory for the maximum lift coefficient
of certain classes of airfoilsthis theory gave satisfactory
agreement with experiment but no direct experimental
check on the boundary layer analysis itself has
been given up to the present .air flow inseparating laminar boundary layerthe speed distribution inlaminar boundary layer on
the surface of an elliptic cylinder, of major and minor
axes 11.78 and 3.98 inches, respectively, has been determined
by means ofhot-wire anemometerthe direction
of the impinging air stream was parallel to the major axisspecial attention was given to the speed distribution in
the region of separation and to the exact location of the
point of separationan approximate method, developed
by k. pohlhausen for computing the speed distribution,
the thickness of the layer, and the point of separation, is
described in detail,. and speed-distribution curves calculated
by this method are presented for comparison with
experimentgood agreement is obtained along the forward
part of the cylinder, but pohlhausen's method fails
shortly before the separation point is reached and consequently
cannot be used to locate this pointthe work was carried out at the national bureau of
standards with the cooperation and financial assistance
of the national advisory committee for aeronautics .analysis and calculation by integral methods of laminarsurvey of integral methods in laminar-boundary-layer

method for practical purposes of calculating the properties

wall is then presentedfor flow overflat plate, the method
is applicable for an arbitrarily prescribed distribution of
temperature along the surface and for any given constant
prandtl number close to unityfor flow inpressure gradient,
the method is based onprandtl number of unity anduniform
wall temperaturea simple and accurate method of determining
the separation point incompressible flow with an adverse
pressure gradient oversurface atgiven uniform wall temperature
is developedthe analysis is based on an extension of
the karman-pohlhausen method to the momentum and thermal
energy equations in conjunction with fourth- and especially
higher degree velocity and stagnation-enthalpy profilesfrom
the equations derived here, conclusions regarding the effect of
pressure gradient, mach number, and wall temperature on the
boundary-layer characteristics are derived and illustratedin
particular the effects on skin-friction, heat-transfer coefficient,
separation point in an adverse pressure gradient, and stability
of the laminar boundary layer are analyzed .the buckling ofsquare panel under shear, when one
reasons for investigation.--for an efficient design
of spar with thin sheet web it is important to know
the load which will just cause the web to buckleas stiffeners
divide the web into panels, it is required to find the
buckling stress of rectangular panels bounded on two sides by
spar flanges and on the other two sides by stiffenersboundary conditions which represent closely this type of edge
fixing are clamping (along the flanges) and simple support
critical shear stress forsquare panel held in this wayconclusions and further development.--it is found that the
value of the critical shear stress is almost midway between
its values when all four edges are clamped and all four edges
are simply supportedthe method of solution developed in this report is of very
general application, and can be used to investigate the
stability of rectangular panels when the loading is any combination
of shear and compression or tension, and the edges
are clamped or simply supported, and not necessarily all clamped
or all simply supportedby an easy extension the
method of solution can also be used to find the periods of transverse
vibration of rectangular panels for the same types
of loading and edge fixing .a process for the step-by-step integration of differential
it is advantageous in automatic
computers to employ methods of integration
which do not require preceding function values
to be knownfromgeneral theory given by
kutta, one such process is chosen giving fourthorder
accuracy and requiring the minimum
number of storage registersit is developed intoform which gives the highest attainable
accuracy and can be carried out by comparatively
few instructionsthe errors are studied andsimple example is given .numerical construction of detached shock wavesthis article proposesnew method for solving the problem
of the detached shock waveif the shock wave is assumed
known,cauchy problem forsystem of partial differential
equations arisesthis has been solved by several authors
in the region where the system is elliptic (near the peak of
the shock wave)considering the plane stationary case, the
author seeks an analytic continuation of the propagation
function (x,y) in the complex plane= y1y2,realin the plane (x, y2) the propagation function satisfieshyperbolic equation (near the peak of the shock wave)a
new cauchy problem is solved and the solution of the original
problem obtained by analytic continuationa numerical
example is treated with many details .on the numerical calculation of detached bow shockmethod is described for calculating examples of hypersonic
flow withdetached bow shock wave pastbluff axially symmetric
bodythe form of the shock wave is assumed, and the
analysis is based oncauchy problem for the stream function
in the subsonic region, where the motion is governed bypartial
differential equation of elliptic typethrough analytic continuation
into the complex domain, the cauchy problem is reformulated
in suchmanner that it becomes properly set in the
subsonic regionthis leads tostable scheme for computation
of the flow by finite differencesnumerical examples at freestream
mach number 5.8 are presented in which the flow is determined
throughout the subsonic region, and, in particular, the
detachment distance, the location of the sonic line, and the pressure
distribution along the body are calculatedthese results are
in excellent agreement with experimental data obtained at the
california institute of technology .shock wave and flow field development in hypersonic re-entrya study is made of when and howshock wave and continuum-type flow
field develop in the nose region ofhighly cooled blunt body re-entering
the atmosphere at hypersonic speed and infree molecular flow
regimethe various types of flow regimes encountered down to low altitude
conditions are delineated, and the nature of the flow field and
behavior of some of the aerodynamic characteristics are discussedit
is shown that forhighly cooled body, free molecule flow conditions
occur athigher altitude than previously indicatedbased on available
evidence, it is suggested that kinetic theory solutions, which are
essentially modified free molecule results, along with the navier-stokes
 equations with no surface slip, serve to define all of the flow regimes
 except fornarrow transitional layer regime which hasheight of
less than one factor of 10 in free stream density changeit is also
suggested that the appearance ofdefinable shock wave occurs very
rapidly in terms of density change near the beginning of the transitional
layer regime, and that its location, as in continuum flow, is
governed principally by the body geometry, whereas its thickness is
determined bylocal mean free path .the solution of small displacement, stability or vibration
this report describes an energy method for
the exact solution of problems concerning the small
displacements, stability or vibration offlat rectangular panel
when the edges are either clamped or simply supportedthe influence of stiffeners which are parallel to one pair of edges,
and situated in pairs on opposite sides of the panel
so that the neutral axis of each stiffener pair lies in the middle
surface of the panel, is taken into accountthe method
is not only applicable to isotropic panels but also to aeolotropic
panels when the material of the panel has two directions
of elastic symmetry parallel to the edgesthe final solution of the problems depends on an infinite set of
linear equations for small displacement problems or on
an infinite determinantal equation for stability and vibration
problemsthe important feature of the analysis given is
that it enablesdirect approach to be made to these equations
in any particular problemit is not in general possible
to obtaindirect solution of the final equations and it is
necessary to approximate and considerfinite set of linear
equations orfinite determinantal equation derived from the
more important terms in the analytical expression for the
transverse displacement of the panelhere, physical intuition
and, if available, experimental data serve asguide and
the accuracy of the final results so obtained is gauged by the
rate of convergence with the increase in the number of
terms consideredthe general method of solution is applied first to the free
vibration ofsquare panel when all the edges are clamped,
and second to the buckling ofsquare panel under shear when
three edges are clamped and one edge is simply supported .heat transfer near the forward stagnation point of
in order to determine the temperature distribution overbody moving through the atmosphere,knowledge of the
local heat-transfer coefficients is requiredfor slender sharpnosed
bodies, the heat-transfer coefficients are frequently approximated
by using the comparable flat-plate valueshowever,
for blunt-nosed bodies, flat-plate solutions are not applicable
near the forward stagnation pointsince the greatest rate
of heat transfer may occur at the forward stagnation point, its
value should be investigatedin this notetheoretical solution
is given for the heat transfer near the forward stagnation point ofbody of revolution assuming laminar, incompressible, low-speed
flowthe comparable solution for two-dimensional flow has
been given by squirein the case ofblunt-nosed body moving
with supersonic velocity, the flow behind the central portion of
the bow wave is subsonic, and it is possible thatlow-speed solution,
using as /free-stream/ conditions those behind the center
of the bow wave, will apply near the stagnation point .stagnation point heat transfer measurements in hypersonic
in hypersonic, low reynolds number flow aroundblunt body,
the boundary-layer thickness approaches the shock-layer
thickness (shock standoff distance) within the region of continuum
flowin this instance, the customary boundary-layer
approximations no longer applyhoshizaki and probstein
have obtained solutions to the incompressible navier-stokes
equations in the stagnation region ofblunt body in this hypersonic
low reynolds number flowthe results indicate that heattransfer
rates are substantially higher than those predicted by incompressible
boundary-layer theoryprobstein indicated that
the actual heat-transfer rates would be correspondingly higher
than the predictions of fay and riddellthese findings are of
particular importance in the atmospheric entry phase of recoverable
satellites .low density stagnation point heat transfer measurements

the paper presentssolution to the buckling of infinitely long
plates clamped along the edges, together with an extension of the
solution obtained by stein and fralich for the case when the edges are
simply-supportedit is shown that, asconsequence of increasing the
edge support from that ofsimple support to one in which both
deflection and rotation are prevented, the rigidity which an
intermediate transverse stiffener must possess in order to support the
plate effectively is much reducedagreement between the theoretical
relationships and existing experimental data is good .critical shear stress of an infinitely long simplytheoretical solution is given for the critical shear stress of
an infinitely long, simply supported, flat plate with identical, equally
spaced, transverse stiffeners of zero torsional stiffnessresults are
obtained by means of the lagrangian multiplier method and are presented
in the form of design chartsexperimental results are included and
are found to be in good agreement with the theoretical results .stability of rectangular plates under shear and bending
the author first discusses the problem ofplane, simply
supported rectangular plate loaded by shearing forces in
the plane of the plate on all four edgesthere are two
stiffeners attached one third and two thirds of the way
along the platethe critical load is calculated for various
stiffener rigiditiesalso, the rigidity necessary to keep
the stiffeners straight when the plate buckles is foundthis stiffener rigidity is found to be slightly larger than
that necessary forplate with one stiffener and the same
panel dimensions as the plate with two stiffenersthe second problem discussed by the author is that ofplane, simply supported rectangular plate loaded by uniformly
distributed edge shearing forces in the plane of the
plate and linearly distributed tension and compression in
the plane of the plate at the endsthe end forces vary
from tension, at one corner to, at the other corner,
so that their resultant isbending momentthe presence
of the edge shearing forces is found to diminish the
critical bending stress in this casecalculations are made
for various magnitudes of bending and shearing forces for
plates of various proportions .buckling of transverse stiffened plates under shearthis paper presents an analysis of buckling of simply
